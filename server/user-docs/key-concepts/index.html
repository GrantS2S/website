    <p>There are a few core components that make up Stock2Shop. Here are explanations of these key concepts, so you can better understand how we make your business work better.</p>
<p>Stock2Shop offers system integration between many different applications: ERP or accounting systems (Sage, SYSPRO, iSync or SAP) and e-commerce websites (WooCommerce, Shopify, Magento or B2B trade store).
