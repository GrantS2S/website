      <description>What does this mean It means that there are different shipping options on checkout when ordering a product on their Website. Parcel Ninja also has specific shipping options: Namely - Collection, Overnight, and Next Day. These shipping options must be mapped from the Website to Parcel Ninja
This development would need to be done in the S2S Console. using the order information for each shipping option required.
What issue(s) can arise A customer buys an order from the website and expects to collect the order, but the order has been sent to Parcel Ninja for delivery (If the custom mapping has not been developed), thus the shipping options will not match Parcel Ninja automatically.</description>
