      <description>Introduction This article is a breakdown and explanation as to how the S2S system finds, saves and uses the channel&amp;rsquo;s product ids.
Any data storage system will have an internal ID to store data against and use as reference to related sets of data.
The S2S system, when adding a product (This can be creating or linking) to a channel product, will search for the product by SKU code on the platform, find the product ID and then save that ID in the S2S system in order to update the product at a later stage more efficiently.</description>

      <description>What does this error mean? Stock2Shop sends ex vat prices of orders to ERP/Accounting System with a specific tax code which calculates the inclusive tax on the system. This means if Tax is set up incorrectly on Shopify, or if the tax code configured is not the same rate as the website tax the calculation won&amp;rsquo;t be correct on the ERP/Accounting sideÂ What issue(s) does this cause? This issue causes a mismatch of order totals in the ERP vs S2S/Shopify</description>
