      <description>Choose when Orders process to your ERP Orders can be sent to your ERP based on the last status sent from Woocommerce. Once your Order has a status of &amp;lsquo;Processing&amp;rsquo; it means the payment has completed and the Order is now complete, we use this status by default.
Sync specific Product data All Product data sent from Stock2Shop can be filtered as needed. You might not require a certain amount of details to be sent through with the Product data.</description>
