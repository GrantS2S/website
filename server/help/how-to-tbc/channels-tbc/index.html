<h2 id="stock2shop-sales-channels">Stock2Shop Sales Channels</h2>
<p>A Stock2Shop sales channel is a platform which you can sell your Product to Customers. Channels usually allow customers
to put your products into a basket and checkout with them (order them). The information from the sale is then returned
to Stock2Shop as a sales order.Several processes can then be started, depending on your
integration requirements and your unique workflow.</p>
<p>Currently, Stock2Shop supports the following sales channels:</p>
<h3 id="what-channels-are-available">What Channels are available</h3>
<ul>
<li>B2B trade store</li>
<li>Magento 1.x</li>
<li>Magento 2.x</li>
<li>Shopify</li>
<li>WooCommmerce</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="set-up-and-configuration">Set up and configuration</h3>
<p>Stock2Shop is a multi-channel platform. This means that you can push your product and inventory information to many
different channels, and only have to maintain one source of product information.
Each channel can be configured differently. Configuration on a channel usually refers to things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping rules</li>
<li>Payment gateways</li>
<li>Customer accounts</li>
<li>Price tiers</li>
</ul>
<p>Each sales channel has its own set of configuration and requirements.</p>
