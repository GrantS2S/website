<h1>Microsoft Dynamics Nav Magento Integration Integration</h1>
<p class="lead">If you’re using Microsoft Dynamics NAV as your ERP and running a Magento e-commerce website, it’s important that they are in sync to ensure the most efficient workflow. Stock2Shop works in conjunction with Microsoft Dynamics NAV to create an Microsoft Dynamics NAV Magento integration – for a seamless e-commerce experience.</p>

<h1>TODO: workflows for source-channel's</h1>

<h2 id="sync-inventory-data">Sync inventory data</h2>
<p>Easily and quickly sync your product information from Microsoft Dynamics NAV to Magento.</p>
<ul>
<li>Details like the SKU, price, stock level and product title will all be synced with Stock2Shop, so that your product data is always up-to-date. Products can also be updated on schedule (up to every 30 minutes).</li>
<li>Syncing images between Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Magento is also simple once you’ve integrated with Stock2Shop, and you can upload or remove images automatically.</li>
<li>Once you’ve configured products correctly on Microsoft Dynamics NAV (we can help), fields from Microsoft Dynamics NAV can be “mapped” to any attribute on Magento. We’ll work with you to create a flexible system that suits your needs.</li>
<li>You’ll be able to allow multi-level category management, so that a product can be assigned to a category and a sub-category, and so on.</li>
<li>If you have variations in your products (e.g. one cap that comes in multiple sizes), we can create one “configurable product” with multiple “simple products” in Magento automatically. You can also assign images to each product for swatches.</li>
<li>Any time you need to update any attribute on any of your products, you can do it with ease. It’s no longer an exhausting manual process, but a quick and seamless change that can be synced across all of your platforms.</li>
<li>Inventory management can also be set per product – you may want to choose specific products to manage stock.</li>
<li>Multiple Magento websites? No problem. Stock2Shop’s sophisticated system lets you manage all your data in one central place, with near real time updates.</li>
<li>If you’ve set up multiple stores, you can choose which store to sync to, and when.</li>
<li>With numerous user defined fields and price lists on Microsoft Dynamics NAV, as well as the option for multi-currency sales, your ERP is the brain of your business. Once we’ve integrated it with your Magento e-commerce website, you can be sure that all the necessary data is in the right place, without the risk of human error.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enrich-data">Enrich data</h2>
<p>Enriching product data doesn’t have to be a big job. Once you’ve integrated Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Magento, it’s simple and stress-free.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose which workflow is best for you: you can sync only SKU, title, quantity and price to Stock2Shop. You can then edit fields such as vendor, product type, collection and images directly on Stock2Shop, which will automatically update Magento.</li>
<li>Or you can update these fields directly on Magento. Using Stock2Shop flags makes it simple to decide which system manages which field.</li>
<li>As soon as a product is saved, you can update the corresponding Magento attribute.</li>
<li>Because the whole system is automated via Stock2Shop, whatever changes you make on your central console are synced with Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Magento, seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="simplify-ordering">Simplify ordering</h2>
<p>The ordering process should be as seamless as possible, for your business and your customers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole process is automated, to make it as seamless as possible.</li>
<li>As soon as an order is placed on your Magento e-commerce website, it can be raised automatically into Microsoft Dynamics NAV as a quote or an invoice.</li>
<li>It’s up to you whether you want all orders to be raised into Microsoft Dynamics NAV, or only the ones that have reached “paid” (or other) status.</li>
<li>You can push orders to Microsoft Dynamics NAV, and not update stock levels or product information, or only update products and not raise orders (a one-way sync) if necessary.</li>
<li>Invoices can be emailed automatically to the customer.</li>
<li>If you use your Magento e-commerce website for wholesaling and B2B orders, you can assign different customer groups on Magento to different price lists.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="streamline-ordering">Streamline ordering</h2>
<p>You can streamline your ordering process in conjunction with Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Stock2Shop, to make it work for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping costs added to an order can be created as a line item (service item) on the Microsoft Dynamics NAV invoice or quote.</li>
<li>Orders can be assigned to specific sales reps.</li>
<li>You can add customer-generated references to each order.</li>
<li>You can choose to allow negative stock, if required.</li>
<li>You can set the due day for each order.</li>
<li>It’s easy to calculate discounts (including or excluding tax).</li>
<li>You can choose whether to send information from checkout fields to Microsoft Dynamics NAV.</li>
<li>It’s up to you to decide whether Microsoft Dynamics NAV creates the order code, or you use the Magento order code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="automate-order-fulfillment">Automate order fulfillment</h2>
<p>Order fulfillment is simple once you’ve integrated Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Magento.</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll be able to set up order fulfillment to run automatically.</li>
<li>Choose to fulfill the order depending on its status (e.g. paid).</li>
<li>Customise order fulfillments according to your workflow requirements.</li>
<li>Have a totally automated solution: from placing an online order to delivery.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="customise-notifications">Customise notifications</h2>
<p>Customising notifications helps you to streamline your workflow even more.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can choose which people receive notifications for specific activities, such as when orders are received, when orders are processed to Microsoft Dynamics NAV, when orders fail or when product updates fail.</li>
<li>Help your team focus by only notifying them of tasks directly related to their work.</li>
<li>Reduce the possibility of human error by ensuring nothing goes unnoticed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="run-a-b2b-store">Run a B2B store</h2>
<p>We can help you set up a B2B store that’s linked to your Magento e-commerce website and also to Microsoft Dynamics NAV. You’ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Map different price lists to customer groups in Magento. This easily turns your website into a B2B store, with all your custom branding and design.</li>
<li>Allow customers to register and assign them a customer account number from Microsoft Dynamics NAV, so that orders can be processed into their customer account.</li>
<li>Limit number of products per customer group.</li>
<li>Implement a verification process for trade customers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="streamline-workflow">Streamline workflow</h2>
<p>Once you’ve integrated Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Magento, one of the biggest changes you’ll see is a much more streamlined workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of having to juggle various data sets, everything is in one place, one central console – easy to work with.</li>
<li>With one central console, your Stock2Shop queue shows all data activity. This queue ensures you never lose precious data (updates or orders) – even if Microsoft Dynamics NAV or Magento go offline. You can assign certain people to receive notifications of certain activity, such as orders or errors. You can see orders coming in, with their corresponding order code from Magento and from Microsoft Dynamics NAV. And you can monitor product updates. All in one place.</li>
<li>It’s business as usual, just better.</li>
