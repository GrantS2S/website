      <description>Stock2Shop uses a token based system for accessing our API. Each request sent to our API needs a valid token.
Authentication is the process of providing a valid username and password to Stock2Shop and receiving a token in return. This token is then used on subsequent requests to our API.
Tokens should be treated as ephemeral. If you are developing an application you need to automate your authentication process in the case your token becomes invalid.</description>

      <description>Scenario You would like to replay or re-post an order to Stock2Shop on behalf of a channel. Perhaps you are wanting to test changes or test a channel without having to reproduce the order manually.
 Solution You are going to POST a valid JSON payload to the sales channel. Depending on the sales channel, the payload will look different. For example, a Shopify order will follow the format of the shopify webhook and a Woocommerce order will follow the Woocommerce format.</description>

      <description>Channel Rules can determine which items sync to your channel / web store.
 What are channel rules? Channel rules give you the ability to determine which products are displayed on a specific sales channel as well as when they should be displayed.
 Why are channel rules importnant? This is extremely useful for managing which data will be available to your relevant Site. For example, we can use a Rule to prevent a product from syncing to the selected channel if it does not contain any images, this prevents items showing up on your Website without an image associated.</description>

      <guid>/uncategorised/parcelninja/features/multiple-shipping-options/</guid>
      <description>What does this mean It means that there are different shipping options on checkout when ordering a product on their Website. Parcel Ninja also has specific shipping options: Namely - Collection, Overnight, and Next Day. These shipping options must be mapped from the Website to Parcel Ninja
This development would need to be done in the S2S Console. using the order information for each shipping option required.
What issue(s) can arise A customer buys an order from the website and expects to collect the order, but the order has been sent to Parcel Ninja for delivery (If the custom mapping has not been developed), thus the shipping options will not match Parcel Ninja automatically.</description>

      <description>Here’s all you need to know about multiple warehouses on Stock2Shop.
Your ERP or accounting system may have a multiple warehouse function which allows you to keep track of stock that sits in multiple warehouses around the country. It is important to note that not all ERP and accounting systems provide for this functionality.
We calculate stock availability as “stock on hand” less “stock on sales order”. We can then handle the available stock quantity in various forms to meet your business requirement.</description>

      <description>Sync data You’ll be able to sync inventory data and pricing with ease once you’ve integrated with Stock2Shop.
 Sync your product information from SAP to your Takealot marketplace. This includes the price, recommended retail price, lead time and stock availability, and can be updated near real time.

      <guid>/uncategorised/woocommerce/questions/why-is-both-product-and-variant-channel-ids-in-stock2shop-0/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Why is this product got a zero value in both channel ID&amp;rsquo;s?
This occurs when the channel settings in S2S are set to not create the product on WooCommerce, this is normally decided during the setup of your integration, meaning that our system must only update existing products on WooCommerce.
When a product is then made active to sync from your ERP/Accounting system and cannot find that sku in WooCommerce the system will assign the ID&amp;rsquo;s of zero to prevent the product from creating queue blocking errors.</description>

      <description>What does this error mean? Stock2Shop sends ex vat prices of orders to ERP/Accounting System with a specific tax code which calculates the inclusive tax on the system. This means if Tax is set up incorrectly on Shopify, or if the tax code configured is not the same rate as the website tax the calculation won&amp;rsquo;t be correct on the ERP/Accounting side What issue(s) does this cause? This issue causes a mismatch of order totals in the ERP vs S2S/Shopify</description>
