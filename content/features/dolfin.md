### Update Stock2Shop hourly with Product data changes
When changes are made to your Dolfin system, we can set an hourly time to check for Product updates.
This can be set for which ever minute on the hour best suits your workflow.

<!-- order_source_customer_code_map -->
### Raise Orders against Customers in Dolfin
When Orders process to Dolfin, they can either:

- Be raised against a single account for Online sales

<!-- shipping_code -->
### Track Shipping costs
If you have a stock unit in Dolfin to track Shipping costs against, we can have that 
applied to each Order when sending to Dolfin if Shipping applies.

<!-- product_map -->
### Sync specific Product data 
All Product data sent from Dolfin can be filtered as needed.
We might not require a certain amount of details to be sent through with the needed Product data.
In these cases, we can synchronize only the required data into Stock2Shop to then push up to your Webstore.
