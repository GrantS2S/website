### Update Stock2Shop hourly with Product data changes
When changes are made to your Efinity system, we can set an hourly time to check for Product updates.
This can be set for which ever minute on the hour that best suits your workflow.

<!-- create_order_enabled -->
### Create orders on your Efinity ERP
This allows Stock2Shop to create an order on Efinity when an order has been received from your sales channel(s).

<!-- product_map -->
### Sync specific Product data 
All Product data sent from Efinity can be filtered as needed.
You might not require a certain amount of details to be sent through with the Product data.
In these cases, we can synchronize only the required data into Stock2Shop to then push up to your Webstore.
