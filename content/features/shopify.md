### Track Stock Levels
Stock2Shop can track stock quantities on Shopify and prevent Overselling of Products. 
Product quantity values will be sent from your ERP to Shopify and deductions will process from your ERP after Orders are raised. 

<!-- queue_fulfill_odder -->
### Fixed Fulfillment Orders
When Orders come from Shopify to Stock2Shop, we can fulfill all orders sent, or certain Orders based on Shipping options selected on Shopify.

<!-- qty_limit_upper -->
### Limit Sellable Quantity
You have the option of limiting the amount of stock that gets sent to your Shopify store which in turn limits the amount that can be Ordered.

<!-- send_customer_email -->
### Send Emails to Customers
When Orders process through our system, we can have your Customers notified of the Order status. 
This is useful if your Shopify Notifications being sent before the Order is raised into your ERP.

<!-- hide_product_enabled -->
### Create unpublished Products
When using Stock2Shop to create Products on your Shopify store, we have the option of making the Products live as they are created by Stock2Shop.
This can be useful if you need to add additional Product data to your Products on Shopify, or as a final measure to make sure the product is ready before going live.

<!-- ignore_category_enabled -->
### Sync to Categories
Stock2Shop can connect to your existing Categories on Shopify, or create new categories from your ERP.

<!-- auto_sync -->
### Link to your existing Products
If you have Products loaded to Shopify already, you can use Stock2Shop to link the Products from your ERP to the Products on Shopify.
Stock2Shop will search Shopify for the SKU codes you have connected from your ERP, and will update those it finds on Shopify, 
while creating new Products for those that are not yet on Shopify.
