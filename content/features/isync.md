### Update Stock2Shop hourly with Product data changes
When changes are made to your iSync system, we can set an hourly time to check for Product updates.
This can be set for which ever minute on the hour best suits your workflow.

### Sync specific Product data 
All Product data sent from iSync can be filtered as needed.
We might not require a certain amount of details to be sent through with the needed Product data.
In these cases, we can synchronize only the required data into Stock2Shop to then push up to your Webstore.
