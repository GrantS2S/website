When integrating with iQ Retail, we can pull Images associated with the relevant Products into Stock2shop.
These Images will be applied to the Products and will be added to the Webstore when the Product is synced through.

### Push Products
We can update your Product data from iQ Retail in 3 minute intervals. This allows us to have accurate data on your 
Webstore.

<!-- param_create_customer_enabled -->
### Create Customers
When a new customer places an Order, we can add them to your Customers if they do not exist yet.
This is useful for future Orders to be processed into the same account.

### Default Customer Account
When an Order is placed and no Customer is applied, we can raised Orders against a Set Customer in your iQ Retail.
This can be useful if you have multiple Webstores integrated. 
You can have one Customer Account for Shopify cash sales for example.
