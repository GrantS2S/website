Does this sound like you?

You have a retail business (B2C) that sells direct to consumers (B2C) via a physical store and an ecommerce website. In your physical store, customers browse your shelves and checkout at a point of sale (POS) which captures orders into your accounting system.

Your ecommerce website is becoming a more and more lucrative source of revenue, but keeping your product information accurate can be labour-intensive. Once a week you export pricing and stock level data from your accounting system, and compare them to your website to ensure it’s up to date. Someone in your organisation is tasked with collating your retail online orders and manually capturing them on your ERP / accounting system.

## Challenges you may be facing:
- Your website is not showing your latest inventory information, so you are at risk of overselling or selling at the wrong price.
- Customers’ orders are not captured immediately in your ERP / accounting system, which could result in fulfillment delays.
- Your admin staff is required to manually update product data, as well as input online orders on your ERP / accounting system. This can expose your company to human error.

## How Stock2Shop can help you:
- Inventory and product information is synced from your ERP / accounting system to your ecommerce website.
- Retail customers can place orders on your ecommerce website.
- As soon as a sale is captured in your physical store’s POS, it syncs to your ERP where stock availability is affected. This reduction in inventory is then communicated to your website, dramatically reducing the risk of overselling.
- Your admin staff is notified as soon as an order is received.
- You get to manage vital product data for your ecommerce website in one place - on your ERP / accounting system.

In short, Stock2Shop has reduced human error, reduced duplicate data capturing and increased efficiency.
