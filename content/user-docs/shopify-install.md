### Introduction

The steps below will guide you in creating a private application in Shopify. Stock2Shop requires all these settings to be configured prior to configuration. For technical information about the Shopify API visit [this page](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/reference).

### Creating a private app

Login to your Shopify store backend and navigate to select **Apps > Manage Private Apps**. Once you have navigated to **Manage Private Apps**, click **Create a new private app**.

Fill in the App details section as shown in the image below. Set all permissions to the highest possible, **Read and Write** being the highest or **Read access** if **Read and write** is not available on the individual dropdown.

Once you have completed filling out all the details and setting permission, be sure to **save** the app. A pop-up modal will appear asking to confirm you understand. Click **I understand, Create the app**. You will be directed to a page that will display the **API key** and **API Password**.
