## Introduction

Parcelninja is an outsourced e-commerce warehousing and order fulfillment service, allowing you to run your e-commerce business from anywhere. Using their feature-rich API or plugin for your existing cart system, cloud integration is seamless and fulfillment is no longer a headache. Through Parcelninja’s Courier LiveQuote™ they’ll get you the cheapest possible delivery price — instantly.

This integration allows you to automatically sync stock levels from Parcelninja into Stock2Shop and send them to multiple sales channels such as Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce and Stock2Shops B2B Trade store. Each time incoming or outgoing products affect your Parcelninja stock levels, Stock2Shop will update your sales channels accordingly to ensure that you don’t oversell.
