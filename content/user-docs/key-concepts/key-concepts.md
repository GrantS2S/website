There are a few core components that make up Stock2Shop. Here are explanations of these key concepts, so you can better understand how we make your business work better.

Stock2Shop offers system integration between many different applications: ERP or accounting systems (Sage, SYSPRO, iSync or SAP) and e-commerce websites (WooCommerce, Shopify, Magento or B2B trade store). Using the Stock2Shop software efficiently and getting the maximum benefit from the platform requires an understanding of the key concepts.

In this section of the documentation, we outline some of these key concepts.
