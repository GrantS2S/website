What do we mean when we say channels? Places to display and sell your goods. Here’s all you need to know about Stock2Shop sales channels.

### What is a sales channel?

A Stock2Shop sales channel is an application or platform which can display your product and inventory data. Channels usually allow customers to put your products into a basket and checkout with them (order them). The information from the sale is then returned to Stock2Shop as a sales order. Several processes can then be started, depending on your integration requirements and your unique workflow.

### Set up and Configuration

Stock2Shop is a multi-channel platform. This means that you can push your product and inventory information to many different channels, and only have to maintain one source of product information.  
  
Each channel can be configured differently. Configuration on a channel usually refers to things like:

*   Shipping rules
*   Payment gateways
*   Customer accounts
*   Price tiers

Each sales channel has its own set of configuration and requirements.
