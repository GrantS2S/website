Here’s all you need to know about the relationship between products, options and variants on Stock2Shop.

* * *

### What is a product?

A product contains information such as title, collection, description, vendor, product type and images.  
**Each product must contain at least one or more variants.**  
  
For example, if you sell shoes, your product may have the following properties:

Title: Pegasus 2  
Collection: Sports Shoes  
Vendor: Athletics Co Ltd  
Type: Running Shoe

This product may be available in multiple sizes and may come in several colours.  
Each variant for the above product would have a unique size / colour combination.

### What are product options?

A product may or may not have options, depending if it requires multiple variants or not.  
In the above shoe example, the product would have two options: size and colour.

### What is a variant?

A variant contains information about each product option such as SKU, weight, price and availability (stock levels).  
In the above shoe example, you may hold 3 different sizes in 2 colours. The variants would look like this:

SKU: ABC-1

SKU: ABC-2

SKU: ABC-3

QTY: 5

QTY: 0

QTY: 15

Weight: 100g

Weight: 105g

Weight: 110g

Price: 80

Price: 80

Price: 80

Option1: size 8

Option1: size 9

Option1: size 10

Option2: red

Option2: red

Option2: red

SKU: ABC-4

SKU: ABC-5

SKU: ABC-6

QTY: 2

QTY: 6

QTY: 5

Weight: 100g

Weight: 105g

Weight: 110g

Price: 80

Price: 80

Price: 80

Option1: size 8

Option1: size 9

Option1: size 10

Option2: blue

Option2: blue

Option2: blue

  

As you can see in the above example, the red and blue shoes come in 3 different sizes.  
**It is important that each variant has a unique combination of options.**

### How to handle variation when importing data into Stock2Shop

When importing data into Stock2Shop, we need to be able to define the above “parent/child” relationship in a flat data structure (spreadsheet).  
  
In order to do this, we have some field conventions, namely:  

*   source\_product\_code: This is the unique identifier for each parent product.  
    
*   source\_variant\_code: This is the unique identifier for each child variant.  
    
*   option1_name: Describing the option (e.g. size)  
    
*   option1_value: The value for this variant (e.g. size 8)  
    
*   option2_name: Describing the option (e.g. colour)  
    
*   option2_value: The value for this variant (e.g. red)  
    

**We can have a maximum of 3 options only.**
