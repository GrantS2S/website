Below are some recommendations on how to capture and optimise images for use on Stock2Shop. These images will then be sent to WooCommerce, Magento, Shopify and our B2B trade store, depending on what has been configured.

### Preparing for Bulk Updating

The first task most companies face when taking their inventory online is saving their imagery and ensuring these files can be correctly linked to the corresponding products from their system.  
  
Stock2Shop has several ways to manage this process in bulk, which is useful when dealing with a large product range. The simplest way to import images into our system is to maintain a spreadsheet which has the path of the image in one column and the products SKU (unique identifier) in another column.  
  
Rows in your spreadsheet may look like this:  
“pic1.jpg”, “ABC”  
“pic2.jpg”, “XYZ”

### Product Positioning and Angle

It is important to maintain the same angle for each product within the image, especially when you have a catalog of similar products.  
  
In some cases, it is useful to have different angles of the same product. If you do this, try to keep these angles consistent across your range.  
  
Maintain the same “bleed” on each product from the edge of the product to the end of the image. We recommend ensuring that the product is placed in the center of the image and has a small amount of bleed.

### Background

Where possible, ensure that the product images all use the same background. Preferably a “pure white” background, or something that works with your brand and products.

### Ratio

Maintain the same image ratio for all of your product images. You can use any image ratio that works best for the majority of your products, but ensure that it is carried through on your entire range. Some examples of ratios are square 1:1 or portrait 4:3 or landscape 3:4.

### Image Format and Size

A general rule of thumb is that photographic images should be “.jpg” files and graphic images should be “.png” files. You need to test the images for quality after they have been sampled. Often, DTP is required to resample the images into the appropriate format, size and dimensions.  
  
We recommend an image size no larger than 200kb. The height / width dimensions should be around 1200px (72DPI) depending on the shape of your image.  
  
Most of our sales channels (Magento, Shopify, WooCommerce and the Stock2Shop B2B trade store) will create thumbnails and other image sizes based off this original image. They tend to use the original image for “zoom” features on the product details page.
