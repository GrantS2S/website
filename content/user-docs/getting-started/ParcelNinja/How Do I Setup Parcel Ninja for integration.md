## Introduction

Your Parcel Ninja console is set up and you’ve done an ‘inbound’ of products. Now you are ready to move forward with integrating Parcel Ninja with S2S.

The steps below will guide you to get the required settings for S2S/Parcel Ninja configuration. 

The username and password needs to be generated from the Parcel Ninja store via User management, API key, Add API Key and Select Roles to everything except for view Billing, Update users and View users

## Creating API Keys

1.  Click on the ‘Add API Key’ on the right - A pop up will appear where you must enter all the required detail fields for the new API 
2.  You must tick all the required roles for the API.

3. Once this is done, click on the ‘Add Key’ button.

4. Another pop up will appear with the login details for the API you have just created. - You need to take note of these login details as they will only be shown once in this pop up. 

5. Once you have taken down the login details, click on the ‘Close’ button which will close the pop up, and the new API Keys will be added.
