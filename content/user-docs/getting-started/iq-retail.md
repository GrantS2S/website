## Introduction

iQ Retail is a client side ERP system. This means the iQ Retail application is installed on a server at your office, on your actual work computer or on a server in the cloud. In order for Stock2Shop to provide you with the full integration capabilities and link iQ Retail to other sales channels and fulfillments services such as Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce, Stock2Shops B2B Trade store and Parcelninja, we need to install software on the server or computer where your iQ Retail is set up.

## What we need from you

### For Accessing Your Database

In order to communicate with your iQ Retail database, we require the following information:

*   Server Name / IP Address (The Windows name of the server)
*   Database Name (The name of the database (company) we will be connecting to)
*   Database Username (read-only)
*   Database Password (read-only)

### For Accessing Your Server

In order for Stock2Shop to access the data inside of your iQ Retail database and integrate this into other applications, our software has to be installed on the server or computer that has direct access to the iQ Retail database. There are three ways for you to grant us access to install our software on your server:

*   Microsoft Remote Desktop ([See here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/help/17463/windows-7-connect-to-another-computer-remote-desktop-connection))
*   AnyDesk ([See here](https://anydesk.com/en/downloads/))
*   Teamviewer ([See here](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/))

The below must be taken into consideration to ensure we can manage information on a continual basis:

*   Outgoing port 8080 should be open.
*   The server must always be online.
*   The user must have full admin rights.

### For Raising Orders
