## Introduction
Sage 300cloud (Formerly Sage ERP Accpac) is a client-side ERP system. This means the Sage 300cloud application is installed on a server at your office, on your actual work computer or on a server in the cloud. In order for Stock2Shop to provide you with the full integration capabilities and link Sage 300cloud to other sales channels and fulfilment services such as Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce, Stock2Shops B2B Trade store, Parcelninja and Takealot, we need to install software on the server or computer where your Sage 300cloud is set up.

## What we need from you

### For accessing your database
In order to communicate with your Sage 300cloud database, we require the following information:

- Server Name / IP Address
- Database Name
- Database UID
- Database PWD

### For accessing your server
In order for Stock2Shop to access the data inside of your Sage 300cloud database and integrate this into other applications, our software has to be installed on the server or computer that has direct access to the Sage 300cloud database. There are two ways for you to grant us access to install our software on your server:

- Microsoft Remote Desktop [(See here)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/help/17463/windows-7-connect-to-another-computer-remote-desktop-connection))
- AnyDesk [(See here)](https://anydesk.com/en/downloads/)
- Teamviewer [(See here)](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/)

The below must be taken into consideration to ensure we can manage information on a continual basis:

- Outgoing port 8080 should be open.

If you require Stock2Shop to insert sales orders or invoices into your Sage 300cloud, you need to have Web Screens installed and setup. If you are not sure how to do this or need help, please contact your Sage 300cloud representative to guide you through the process.
