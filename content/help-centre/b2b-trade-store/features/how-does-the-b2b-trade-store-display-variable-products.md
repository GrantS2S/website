## What is a variable product

A variable product is one product that has different variations relating to a specific SKU code. To read more about variable products then please read this article - [Products and Variants](/documentation/key-concepts/products-variants/) 

## How are the options/SKUs displayed

This refers to the way the Option/SKU displays on the B2B site when choosing a product to buy. The article gives details of what is/is not possible to change with regards to options and SKU codes once the products have been synced through to S2S.

## How the ordering of options work

Below is where the SKU would be shown if the product was singular, which means if it's not singular the neatest way to show the options is having a drop-down to select the specific SKU to purchase.

After selecting the SKU, the available qty shows in bright green which should make the customer aware of what the stock is.

The select option on category page shows the options in the order that they are loaded in Stock2Shop (depending on the source, the database may activate SKUs in a specific order) and the grid layout(the layout settings are remembered for each customer depending on their selection) shows the options Alphabetically (all numbers will be added first and in ascending order =>  2xl / 3xl / 4xl and so on) followed by letters in Alphabetical order.
