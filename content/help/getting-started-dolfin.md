Dolfin is an online accounting system. 
This means the application lives in the “cloud”. 
Enabling Stock2Shop to work with 
Dolfin is relatively simple. 

In order for Stock2Shop to 
provide you with the full integration features and link your Dolfin system 
to other sales channels and fulfilment services such as 
Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce, Stock2Shops B2B Trade store, 
Parcelninja and Takealot, we need access to your Dolfin account.

Below is all documentation you will need regarding your Dolfin integration from start to finish.
Although this is a guide, Stock2Shop can facilitate complex integrations, however this may result in increased integration time.

## Getting Started (Prerequisites)
In order for Stock2Shop to communicate with Dolfin accounting system, 
we require the following information:

- Product Request URL
- Order Request URL
- Company ID
- Dolfin API Username
- Dolfin API Password

With these credentials, Stock2Shop will be able to integrate with 
Dolfin and perform the following:

1. [Sync products](#sync-products) 
2. [Sync customers (Not Supported)](#sync-customers) 
3. [Raise orders](#raise-orders) 

## Syncing Products to Stock2Shop {#sync-products}
