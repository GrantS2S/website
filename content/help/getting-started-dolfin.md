Dolfin is an online accounting system. This means the application lives in the “cloud”. 
Enabling Stock2Shop to work with Dolfin is relatively simple. In order for Stock2Shop to provide you 
with the full integration features and link your Dolfin system to other sales channels and fulfilment 
services such as Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce, Stock2Shops B2B Trade store, Parcelninja and Takealot, 
we need access to your Dolfin.
Below is all documentation you will need regarding your Dolfin integration from start to finish.

## Getting Started (Prerequisites)

In order for Stock2Shop to communicate with Dolfin accounting system, we require the following information:

- Product Request URL
- Order Request URL
- Company ID
- Username
- Password

With these credentials, Stock2Shop will be able to integrate with Dolfin and perform the following:
1. [Sync products](#sync-products) 
2. [Sync customers (not available)](#sync-customers) 
3. [Raise orders](#raise-orders) 

```
Note: all information will be supplied by a Dolfin (BCX) representitive.
```

## Syncing Products to Stock2Shop {#sync-products}
Stock2Shop makes use of XML query to sync products from Dolfin known as source products into Stock2Shop called system products. 
At this point, once products exist in their correct form on Stock2Shop, we can send these on to a specified channel.
For Stock2Shop to create a minimum viable product to be created or linked to your sales channel(s), we require the following fields:

```
| Dolfin         | Stock2Shop                    |  Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prod           | source_product_code           | This defines the code for the container product                              |
| SKU            | source_variant_code           | Used in the event that your products have options                            |
| WebName        | title                         | The unique identifier for each variant                                       |
| product_active | product_active                | The instruction for Stock2shop to tell the sales channel to manage inventory |
| qty            | variants.retail_price         | The quantity you have in stock to sell online                                |
| price          | variants.qty                  | The price at which you are wanting to sell the product (incl or excl VAT)    |
| SKU            | variants.sku                  | The web friendly title of the product                                        |
| true           | variants.inventory_management | The instruction for Stock2shop to tell the sales channel to manage inventory |

 ```
  
 ```
 Note: fields to by synced from Dolfin to Stock2Shop will vary depending on your sales channel(s). 
 Syncing of products can get far more complex depending on your requirements. 
 The state of your product data in your ERP along with the complexity will impact integration time dramatically.
 ```

## Syncing Customers to Stock2Shop  {#sync-customers}
Stock2Shop currently does not support the syncing of customers from Dolfin to Stock2Shop.
At this point in time there are no plans to build out this functionality.


## Syncing Orders to Dolfin {#raise-orders}
Regardless of the sales channel(s) you have, Stock2shop can automatically raise orders into Dolfin.
The order fields are standard and as such we are only able to pass back information that is generated by the sales channel(s) that is relevant to Dolfin.
The information we require in order to do so is the following:

##### product information

```
| Dolfin  | Stock2Shop           | Description                                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prod    | Description          | This defines the code for the container product                              |
| SKU     | SKU                  | Used in the event that your products have options                            |
| SKU     | QTY                  | The unique identifier for each variant                                       |
| WebName | Line Item Discount   | The web friendly title of the product                                        |
| qty     | Price                | The quantity you have in stock to sell online                                |
| price   | Tax                  | The price at which you are wanting to sell the product (incl or excl VAT)    |
 
 ```

 ##### Customer information
 - First Name
 - Last Name
 - Email
 - Shipping Address details
 - Billing Address details
 
 ##### Other Information
 - Discount by order line item
 - Total order discount

```
Note: The information passed back from each sales channel depends on the default JSON payload supplied via the webhook.
If the order information does not exist on the order webhook payload, Stock2Shop will not be able to make use of it.
