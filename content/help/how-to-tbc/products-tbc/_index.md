## Products
A product contains information such as title, collection, description, vendor, product type and images.

Each product must contain at least one or more variants which contain information such as SKU, price, quantity available, 
barcode, weight etc..  
These fields are only relevant to a variant and not the product as a whole.

Products can be altered in many ways to suit your specific workflow and requirements.  
We have many fields available on Stock2Shop to update from your ERP and then pass data on to your Sales Channel.

Stock2Shop can control which products sync to Stock2Shop and from there which Sales Channel the Products will need to be
associated with.
