You manufacture and or distribute products to businesses (dropshippingretailers) to sell online.
When orders are raised, you fulfill these orders on behalf of the business that sold it.

### Traditional Dropshipping Model 
Traditionally, you send your customers (dropshipping retailers) stock sheets containing product and inventory inventory information. 
This normally includes, product titles, descriptions, options, pricing, quantities and images. This information is
typically stored in your [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations).

Your customers (retailers) then load this information on to their e-commerce website to sell to the public.
Orders are then placed on your customers e-commerce websites which then need to be sent to you via email or some other format.

Once you have received the orders, someone in your organisation will need to manually capture these 
orders into your [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations). Once a sale of an item has been captured, you will need
to send your customers (dropshipping retails) an update on quantity to ensure they do not oversell.

This approach is a problematic for several reasons:
1. It will be difficult to update all customers with accurate quantity levels.
2. It is difficult to control what prices are given to specific customers.
3. Manually re-capturing orders is hugely time consuming and prone to human error.
4. Product information is not stored in one central place.

### New Dropshipping Model
Inventory and product information can be synced from your [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations) and then distributed 
to your customers (dropshipping retailers) e-commerce websites. Specific rules can be setup to distrubite certain products.

Orders from your customers (dropshipping retailers) e-commerce websites will then be raised automatically into your 
ERP / Accounting system where you will then be able deliver the goods to your customer (dropshipping retailers).

This approach is a beneficial for several reasons:
1. Product information can be managed in one central place.
2. Stock2shop will update all your customers e-commerce websites on a regular basis to ensure stock levels and pricing is up to date.
3. Create rules to determine which products, quantities and price your customers (dropshipping retailers) should see.
4. As soon as orders are placed and paid for, they are sent to your [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations).

This is a rudimentary example of how Stock2Shop can accommodate the dropshipping model. In this example, 
Stock2Shop has reduced the administration requirements and processing time for the company, 
ensured that inventory, product and order data is correctly captured. 
Stock2Shop is highly customisable and there are many different configuration options for each of the steps above.
