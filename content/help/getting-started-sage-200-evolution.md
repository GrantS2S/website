Sage 200 Evolution is a client-side ERP system. 
This means that the Sage 200 Evolution application is installed on a 
server at your office, on your actual work computer or on a 
server in the cloud. 

In order for Stock2Shop to provide you 
with the full integration capabilities and link Sage 200 Evolution
to other sales channels and fulfilment services such as 
Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce, Stock2Shops B2B Trade store, 
Parcelninja and Takealot we need to install software on the server or computer where your Sage 200 Evolution is set up. 

Below is all documentation you will need regarding your Sage 200 Evolution integration from start to finish.
Although this is a guide, Stock2Shop can facilitate complex integrations, however this may result in increased integration time.

## Getting Started (Prerequisites)
In order for Stock2Shop to communicate with Sage 200 Evolution ERP system, 
we require the following information:

- Server Name / IP Address
- Database Name
- Evolution Version (Found under help > about on the Evolutions main menu)
- Read-Only Database Username & Password (Provide sql read only username and password for pulling product and customer data.)
- Read / Write Database Username & Password (The SDK requires a sql user with readwrite permissions, provide username and password.)

The below must be taken into consideration to ensure we can manage information on a continual basis:

- Outgoing port 8080 should be open.
- The server must always be online.
- The user must have full admin rights.

With these credentials, Stock2Shop will be able to integrate with 
Sage 200 Evolution and perform the following:

1. [Sync products](#sync-products) 
2. [Sync customers](#sync-customers) 
3. [Raise orders](#raise-orders)

Stock2Shop currently does not support the syncing of customers from Sage 200 Evolution to Stock2Shop. 
At this point in time there are no plans to build out this functionality. 
If customers are a requirement, please read up on how to import customers manually in to your client console, [here](/help/how-it-works-customer-import "Manually import customers into Stock2Shop").
 
## Syncing Orders to Sage 200 Evolution {#raise-orders}
If you require Stock2Shop to insert sales orders or invoices into your Sage 200 Evolution, then we need you to install the Pastel Evolution SDK (Software Developers’ Kit) client connector. 
This process needs to be done directly with Sage and is fairly straightforward. 
They will require a valid Pastel account. The SDK client connector has an annual fee which is paid to Sage directly. The process is:

- Phone Sage Evolution Sales and request the “Pastel Evolution SDK client connector”.
- They will send you an indemnity form. Fill this form out and send it back to them. They will then send you back a registration code.
- Phone up Sage Evolution registrations and ask them to “register” the SDK connector.

Once this is done you should see the module available in your Sage 200 Evolution by viewing “help > about” in Sage 200 Evolution.

By default, Stock2Shop raises orders to Sage 200 Evolution with the following order details:

```
| Sage 200 Evolution | Stock2Shop              | Description                                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

| CustomerID         | customer_code           | Default Customer Account if not specified on customer |
| Delivery Date      | sytem_order.createdate  | Same as Create Date, Req for Sales Orders             |
| Item               | line_item.sku           | Unique code for a product syncing from the website.   |
| Qty                | line_item.qty           | Qty orderd by the customer                            |
