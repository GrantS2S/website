## Syspro
Syspro is a client-side ERP system. 
This means that the Syspro application is installed on a 
server at your office, on your actual work computer or on a 
server in the cloud. 

In order for Stock2Shop to provide you 
with the full integration capabilities and link Syspro 
to other sales channels and fulfilment services such as 
Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce, Stock2Shops B2B Trade store, 
Parcelninja and Takealot we need to install software on the server or computer where your Syspro is set up. 
For more information on the installation of Stock2Shop's software, see our guide on [installing Stock2Shop](/help/setup/installing-stock2shop/ "Installing Stock2Shop for on Premise ERP / Accounting Systems") for on premise ERP / Accounting Systems.

Below is all documentation you will need regarding your Syspro integration from start to finish.

## Syncing Orders to Syspro {#raise-orders}
If you require Stock2Shop to insert sales orders or invoices into your SYSPRO, then we need you to install the SYSPRO eNet Web Services. 
If you are not sure how to do this or need help, please contact your SYSPRO representative to guide you through the process.

We require the eNet Web Services to be installed and, at a minimum, the “SORTOI” business object to be enabled for our Operator. 
The web service should be accessible via a public URL or IP address, e.g.: http://123.123.123.123/sysprowebservices/utilities.asmx 
Along with the aforementioned we would also require the following details:

- Operator Login
- Operator Password
- Company ID

By default, Stock2Shop raises orders to Syspro with the following order details:
