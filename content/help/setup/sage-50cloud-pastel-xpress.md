## Syncing Customers to Stock2Shop {#sync-customers}
Stock2Shop currently does not support the syncing of customers from Sage 50cloud Pastel Xpress to Stock2Shop. 
At this point in time there are no plans to build out this functionality. 
If customers are a requirement, please read up on how to import customers manually in to your client console, [here](/help/how-it-works-customer-import "Manually import customers into Stock2Shop").
 
## Syncing Orders to Sage 50cloud Pastel Xpress {#raise-orders}
If you require Stock2Shop to insert sales orders or invoices into Sage 50cloud Pastel Xpress, 
then we need you to install the Pastel Xpress SDK (Software Developers’ Kit) client connector. 
This process is done directly with Sage and is fairly straightforward. They will ask for a valid Pastel account. 
The SDK client connector is free for Pastel Xpress. The process is:

- Phone Sage 50cloud Pastel Xpress Sales and request the “Pastel Xpress SDK client connector”.
- They will send you an indemnity form. Fill this form out and send it back to them. They will then send you a registration code.
- Phone Sage 50cloud Pastel Xpress registrations and ask them to “register” the SDK connector.

Once this is done you should see the module available in your Sage 50cloud Pastel Xpress by viewing “help > about”.
