## Microsoft Dynamics NAV
Stock2Shop can pull inventory data from multiple databases. The only prerequisite is that the database can be accessed via ODBC. 
We therefore support Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL Server, Pervasive SQL, Hana and many other databases.

For more information on the installation of Stock2Shop's software, see our guide on [installing Stock2Shop](/help/setup/installing-stock2shop/ "Installing Stock2Shop for on Premise ERP / AAccounting Sysytems") for on premise ERP / Accounting Systems.
