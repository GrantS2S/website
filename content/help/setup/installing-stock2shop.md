## Installing Stock2Shop for On Premises ERP's

ERP's which run in the cloud or at your premises that are not SaaS solutions will need to have our software installed.

In order for Stock2Shop to communicate with SAP Business One ERP system,
we require the following information:

- Server Name / IP Address
- Database Name
- Database Username (Read-Only)
- Database Password (Read-Only)
- DI Server

The below must be taken into consideration to ensure we can manage information on a continual basis:

- Outgoing port 8080 should be open.
- The server must always be online.
- The user must have full admin rights.

Below are a list of ERP's which require our software installed.
