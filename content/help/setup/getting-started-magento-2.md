## Magento 2.x
Magento 2.x is a self hosted eCommerce software solution. This means that you (or your developers) deploy and manage the system entirely.
The information below will guide you in confirming the Magento 2.x default REST API has been configured correctly and tested, 
and lastly that the Magento 2.x orders webhook has been setup. Stock2Shop requires all settings to be configured prior to configuration.
