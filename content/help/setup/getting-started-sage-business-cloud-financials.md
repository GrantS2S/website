## Sage Business Cloud Financials
Sage Business Cloud Financials (formerly Sage Live) is an online accounting system. This means the application lives in the “cloud”. Enabling Stock2Shop to work with Sage Business Cloud Financials is relatively simple. In order for Stock2Shop to provide you with the full integration features and link your Sage Business Cloud Financials system to other sales channels and fulfilment services such as Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce, Stock2Shops B2B Trade store, Parcelninja and Takealot, we need access to your Sage Business Cloud Financials account.
