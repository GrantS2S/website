## The Wholesale Model
You have a wholesale business that either purchases
from or manufactures products and sells them to retailers.
 
### Traditional Wholesale Model
Traditionally, you send your customers (retailers) stock sheets 
on a regular basis with updated prices and quantities. 
Once your customer confirms what they want to order, they either email or call you to confirm
what products they want along with the quantities. 
At this point, someone in your organisation needs to manually capture this information into a 
legitimate sales order on your [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations).

This approach is a problematic for several reasons:
1. The customer does not know stock availability at the time of ordering, unless they request an updated list of inventory and pricing.
2. It is difficult to control what prices are given to specific customers.
3. Manually re-capturing orders is hugely time consuming and prone to human error.
4. Product information is not stored in one central place.

### New Wholesale Model 
Customer, inventory and product information can be synced to [Stock2Shop's B2B trade store](/b2b-shopping-cart/)
from your [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations) and orders from this platform are automatically raised as sales orders and converted to invoices in ERP / Accounting system.

Price lists, stock levels and product information is continually sent to the B2B trade store. 
Customers and sales reps are given access to this information to view and order products.

There is strict control around what products and pricing each customer and sales rep gets to see. 
This means when a customer or sales rep logs in to the B2B trade store, they only see the products and price list that has been assigned to them.

This approach is a beneficial for several reasons:
1. Negates the process of someone having to manually send stock sheets
2. Negates the process of someone having to capture orders manually into your [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations)
3. As soon as orders are placed, the stock on hand is updated.
4. Customers will always be able to see what is actually in stock and at what price.
5. Notify business units internally when orders have been raised.

This is a rudimentary example of how Stock2Shop can accommodate the wholesale model.
In this example, Stock2Shop has reduced the administration requirements and processing time for the 
company, ensured that order data is correctly captured, and given customers access to an easy-to-use ordering system.
Stock2Shop is highly customisable and there are many different configuration options for each of the steps above.
