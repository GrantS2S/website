## Importing/Exporting Products and Product Data

Stock2Shops console has the ability to export all your product data fields that sync from your ERP/Accounting system,
make any changes to the fields available and import the data back into the console.

There are certain settings applied to ensure that the data that you have imported does not get overwritten on the next 
sync from your ERP/Accounting system, these setting are a feature called flags, [click here to learn more about flags](/documentation/key-concepts/flags/).

We suggest you contact support@stock2shop.com to find out if your flags have been set up according to the fields
that you would like to make changes to.

## Importing

When importing data into Stock2Shop, the key points to remember are:

1. Only import fields required and fields that have updates to them. Avoid Importing Quantity and Price fields if not being updated.
2. If these fields are updated by your ERP/Accounting system, you should not need to import them.
3. Are the flags set up accordingly (Consult support@stock2shop.com to assist) to update specific fields in Stock2Shop that you are trying to import?
4. Is my import file in plain CSV format?

Once you have populated the correct fields per the above, follow the below steps to process your import:

1. Login to your console - https://console.stock2shop.com/ 
2. [Click here](https://console.stock2shop.com/console/#/products/import) or Hover over the "Products" Tab and Click "Import"
3. Read the fields listed and make sure you are aware of the fields you are importing and have the required fields in place.
4. Select your primary source (Main ERP/Accounting system)
5. Ensure that both **"Skip adding new products"** and "[Ignore flags](/documentation/key-concepts/flags/)"  are ticked **NB**
6. Click on "SELECT FILE" and choose the CSV file that you wish to import.
7. Click on "IMPORT PRODUCTS"
8. The import will process and depending on the size of the import file it may take some time. Once complete, you will
see a breakdown of the Import.

## Processing Queue
Any import into your console will be added to the Queue, hover over Queue and click on "View" you will see the 
lines containing "sync_products" wait for the queue to complete and open one or two products and confirm that your 
import has processed successfully. Should your changes not reflect, or an error occurs check out our [Solutions](/help/how-to/solutions/_index)
or contact support@stock2shop.com for assistance.
