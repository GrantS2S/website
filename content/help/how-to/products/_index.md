## Products
A product contains information such as title, collection, description, vendor, product type and images.
Each product must contain at least one or more variants.

For example, if you sell shoes, your product may have the following properties:

**Title:** Pegasus 2  
**Collection:** Sports Shoes  
**Vendor:** Athletics Co Ltd  
**Type:** Running Shoe  

This product may be available in multiple sizes and may come in several colours.
Each variant for the above product would have a unique size / colour combination.

### Managing Products
There are various ways to get products into Stock2Shop.
If you need to [bulk import](/help/how-to/products/import "importing products into Stock2Shop") products, you can upload 
a CSV file with the required fields and Product data.
You can also Host a CSV file for Stock2Shop to pull product data from on an hourly schedule.

### Enriching Products

There are many different workflows for enriching your Product data, you can enrich the Product fully and Sync it to 
Stock2Shop with all relevant info. If your Source does not cover all fields you wish to update, you can upload a CSV file
