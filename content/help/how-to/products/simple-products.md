## Simple Products

A Simple Product is a product that does not have any variations, for example a product that is only available in one
size or colour is known as a Simple Product.

Stock2Shop supports Simple and [Variable](/help/how-to/products/variable-products) products. Simple products can be synced
to Stock2Shop and from there have them link to existing products on your Sales Channel.

If your Sales Channel contains Variable products, Stock2Shop can link simple products to the individual SKUs that make up 
your Variable product and sync Prices and Inventory levels.
