## The Retail & Wholesale Model 
You have a business that sells both direct to consumer via your own e-commerce website and or a marketplace.
This is considered the retail side of your entity.
Additionally you sell in bulk to retailers who then on sell your products.
This is considered the Wholesale side of your entity.

### Traditional Retail & Wholesale Model 
Traditionally, your organisiton would have an [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations) and potentially an e-commerce website. 
You would also have someone in charge of sending stock sheets and placing orders on behalf of your wholesale clients, the reatailers.

All product information, including product description, options, pricing and quantities would have to be manually exported 
from your [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations) and imported into your e-commerce website.

Once you have all your product information on your e-commerce website, and sales start coming in you 
will again have to export the sales information in the form of orders and manually import them into your ERP / Accounting system. 
Thereafter another manual request must be made to fulfil the order.

Static Stock sheets would need to be sent via mail to your wholesale customers with up to date pricing and quantity levels.
Once the wholesale customer has mailed you back with their intent to purchase, the stock may or may not be available.

This approach is a problematic for several reasons:

1. Manual intervention between the two systems can result in stock and price discrepancies.
2. Product prices and quantities on the e-commerce website may not always be up to date
3. potentially oversell products due to inventory discrepancies
4. Having to capture order information in the [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations) can be a laborious task.
5. Sending static stock sheets to wholesaler doesn't allow for any changes to be taken into consideration
6. Orders could be placed on products on both the e-commerce site at the same time the wholesalers is securing stock.


### New Retail & Wholesale Model
Inventory and product information can be synced to your e-commerce website sales channel from your [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations)
system and orders from your e-commerce website are automatically raised as sales orders and converted to invoices in your ERP / Accounting system.

Additionally, instead of sending your wholesale customers stock sheets via mail, you can give them access to a 
B2B trade Store ordering portal. This allows them to see specific pricing and quantity as well as place orders that will also be automatically 
be raised into your [ERP / Accounting system](/integrations).

This approach is a beneficial for several reasons:

1. Little to no manual intervention between your ERP / Accounting system and your e-commerce website.
2. As soon as orders are placed and paid for, they are sent to your ERP / Accounting system.
3. Automatic inventory and product updates sent from your ERP / Accounting system to your e-commerce website and B2B Trade Store.
4. Notifications automatically sent to your 3rd party fulfillment service to deliver orders.
5. Negate having to manually send stock sheets and place manual orders for your wholesale clients.

This is a rudimentary example of how Stock2Shop can accommodate the retail model. In this example, 
Stock2Shop has reduced the administration requirements and processing time for the company, ensured that inventory, 
product and order data is correctly captured. Stock2Shop is highly customisable and there are many different configuration options for each of the steps above.
