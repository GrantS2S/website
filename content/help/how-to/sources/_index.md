## Stock2Shop Sources
What do we mean when we say sources? The source of information. 
Here’s all you need to know about Stock2Shop sources.

A Stock2Shop source is where we get product / inventory information from or push sales orders to. 
There are two different types of sources on Stock2Shop: “primary sources” and “linked sources“.
