What do we mean when we say channels? Your Webstore/s where you sell your products. These are referred to as Sales Channels.

Hereâ€™s all you need to know about Stock2Shop channels.

Sales channels are where you sell your products to customers, there are 3 types of Channels we can integrate with:
- 3rd Party Webstores (eg: Woocommerce, Shopify, Magento...)
- Stock2Shop's B2B Platform
- Marketplaces (Takealot)

Stock2Shop can connect to an existing channel and update the inventory and pricing of products already loaded, or create
the products on a new channel.
