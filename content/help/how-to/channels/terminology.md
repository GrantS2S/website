Below is a list of terminology commonly used with Stock2Shop Integrations:

#### Channel

A Stock2Shop sales channel is an application or platform which can display your product and inventory data. Channels 
usually allow customers to put your products into a basket and checkout with them (order them). The information from the
sale is then returned to Stock2Shop as a sales order. Several processes can then be started, depending on your 
integration requirements and your unique workflow.
