## Terminology

Below is a list of terminology commonly used with Stock2Shop Integrations:

---

#### Channel

A Stock2Shop sales channel is an application or platform which can display your product and inventory data. Channels 
usually allow customers to put your products into a basket and checkout with them (order them). The information from the
sale is then returned to Stock2Shop as a sales order. Several processes can then be started, depending on your 
integration requirements and your unique workflow.

#### Source

Before adding products to your sales channel(s), the data assigned to the channel depends on the  
[source of data](/help/how-to/sources/index "...") you are using. If you have multiple 
sources/channels they can be configured accordingly. 

A possible scenario could be that you want to link multiple databases where you manage different suppliers to one 
website while your other sales channel only sells out of the one database.
