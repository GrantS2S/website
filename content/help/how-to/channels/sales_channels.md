## Stock2Shop Channels

What do we mean when we say channels? Places to display and sell your goods. Hereâ€™s all you need to know about 
Stock2Shop sales channels.

### What is a sales channel?

A Stock2Shop sales channel is an application or platform which can display your product and inventory data. Channels 
usually allow customers to put your products into a basket and checkout with them (order them). The information from 
the sale is then returned to Stock2Shop as a sales order. Several processes can then be started, depending on your 
integration requirements and your unique workflow.

### What channels are available?

Currently, Stock2Shop supports the following sales channels:

 - B2B trade store
 - Magento
 - Shopify
 - Takealot
 - WooCommmerce

### Setup and configuration

Stock2Shop is a multi-channel platform. This means that you can push your product and inventory information to many 
different channels, and only have to maintain one source of product information.

Each channel can be configured differently. Configuration on a channel usually refers to things like:

 - Shipping rules
 - Payment gateways
 - Customer accounts
 - Price tiers

Each sales channel has its own set of configuration and requirements.
