iQ Retail is a client side ERP system. This means the iQ Retail application is installed on a server at your office, on your actual work computer or on a server in the cloud. 
In order for Stock2Shop to provide you with the full integration capabilities and link iQ Retail to other sales channels and fulfilment services such as 
Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce, Stock2Shops B2B Trade store and Parcelninja, we need to install software on the server or computer where your iQ Retail is set up.
