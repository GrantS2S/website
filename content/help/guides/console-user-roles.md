Stock2Shop console now has the ability for clients to add users and set specific user roles which will be discussed in more detail below. Some users require the ability to make administrative changes while other users only require the ability to read specific information. This provides a level of security that allows the administrative user the ability to add users who donâ€™t have the ability to make changes that could potentially be detrimental.

## Administrator
An Administrator user has access to all settings and functionality of the Stock2Shop console, this includes the configuration of the source and channel settings. The administrator user should be a person/s who has received full training from a Stock2Shop technician and people you trust as they will have access to make changes to your product data, like pricing, qty and important attributes that are used for your live website.
The Administrator user has the ability to do the following:

- Has full access to the console
- View / Add / Import Customers
- View / Export / fetch Orders
- View / Add / Import / Export Products
- Import Product Images
- View / Clear Queue
- Access to settings

## Read Only
A Read Only user should be used when you have a person/s who should not be able to make any changes but needs to review product data or orders. This user role however does allow access to the b2b customer admin login and would be great for sales reps who order on behalf of your customers (Only applicable to S2S trade store).
The Read Only user has access to the following on the console:

- Has Basic Access to the console
- Dashboard
- View Customers
- View Orders
- View Products
- Has the ability to login as a sales representitive to the B2B platform via the console on behalf of a customer to create orders for them.

The Read Only user does not have access to the following on the console:

- Add / Import Customers
- Export / Fetch Orders
- Add / Import / Export Products
- Import Images
- View / Clear Queue
- Settings

## Product Editor
The product editor role is great to use for person/s who enrich your product data but should not have access to fields like qty and price, this role allows access to just product data related to describing or categorizing the products ie: Title; Long Description; Collection; Images and Attributes (Attributes can be used for a range of specific data used to categorize or enrich the product). The user also has the ability to edit and create attribute product templates.

## Product Editor (Attributes Only)
The Product Editor (Attributes Only) has the exact same functionality as a normal Product Editor user, the only difference being that this user does not have access to Images or the ability to edit attribute templates. This user would be great for person/s that should/does not have access to images or the prebuilt product attribute templates.

## Customer Read Only
