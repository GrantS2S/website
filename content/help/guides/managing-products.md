There are various ways to Manage your Product Data in Stock2Shop, we have your initial Sync from a Data Source but there 
might be certain fields on your Sales Channel that are not available in your Accounting System or Data Source. With Stock2Shops
Console, you are able to update your Product data before it gets to your Sales Channel. THere are many available fields 
for you to update and have added to your Products on your Sales Channel without having those fields populated in your ERP.

There are different methods for managing the Product data that ins in the Console. 
These are:

- Linked Source
- CSV Import
- Manual Edit
- Product Editor User

#### Linked Source
[Linked Sources](/help/how-to/sources/linked-sources) can be used to update fields that are not controlled by your 
[Primary Source](/help/how-to/sources/primary-sources) before the Product data is set to the Sales Channel. This can be 
useful for adding things like Images and Long Descriptions that use HTML tags. YOu can also add Attributes to your products
to be used on the Sales Channels or for controlling your product in Stock2Shop.

Contact [Stock2Shop](mailto:sales@stock2shop.com) for more information if you are interested.


#### CSV Import
You can manually import a CSV file into your Console to update Product Data if you do not have all the fields updated
by your ERP. To import a CSV file you can follow the guide [here](/help/how-to/sources/primary-sources)

#### Manual Edit
In the Stock2Shop Console you can open any of your loaded Products and update any fields on the Product. If you update
a field controlled by your Data Source, the field will be overwritten on the next update to that product. To understand
the fields being controlled by your Data Source, check out [Source Flags](/help/how-to/sources/source-flags)


#### Product Editor user
Your Console has may user roles that can be assigned to staff who need access to the Product data. You can add a Product 
Editor to the console users that has the ability to manage the Product data on the console before it is sent to your 
Sales Channel.

Product Editors can add descriptions, images, tags, and other fields.
