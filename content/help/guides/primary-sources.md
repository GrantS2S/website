What do we mean when we say primary sources? The source of information. Hereâ€™s all you need to know about Stock2Shop primary sources.


### What is a primary source?
A Stock2Shop primary source is where we get product / inventory information from or push sales orders to as the primary database of your integration.


### What sources are available?
Stock2Shop provides connections to various different sources. Some of these sources allow sales orders to be raised, others do not.

Currently, Stock2Shop supports the following sources:

- [Sage Pastel Partner](/integrations/pastel-partner/)
- [Sage Evolution](/integrations/sage-200-evolution/) 
- [Sage Accounting](/integrations/sage-one-accounting/) 
- [SAP Business One](/integrations/sap/) 
- [Syspro](/integrations/syspro/)
- [iQ Retail](/integrations/iq-retail/)
- [OmniAccounts](/integrations/omni-accounts/)
- [iSync](/integrations/isync/)
- [dolfin](/integrations/dolfin/)
- Any SQL database
- Any flat file format
- Google Sheets


## Set up and configuration
You can have multiple different sources or just one source.

For example, you may have multiple different sources if your business has branches or stores each with their own accounting / ERP system. In this case, you may want to have one platform to sell your products off (Stock2Shop) and automatically push sales orders into the appropriate source.

If you have multiple different sources, you need unique product codes (SKUs) per source. Orders can then be pushed into the various sources as they are received.
