## What is Bulk Ordering

The S2S B2B Trade Store gives you the ability to bulk import orders via CSV (Comma-separated values). 

This means that should your business use a spreadsheet to record the orders, or order in bulk, they can use the bulk order feature.

Below is a guide to using this feature.

## Bulk ordering process

The bulk ordering process is very simple. Below are the steps to take when bulk ordering:

Find attached to this solution an example of the CSV template.

#### Step 1: Prepare your CSV template
- Make sure your CSV file includes a header row. 
- Your CSV needs the following fields:
    - SKU (unique product identifier)
    - QTY (the number of units to order per SKU)
    - Order number (your purchase order number, used to group rows)
- Update the sheet with the SKU's you are wanting to order along with the quantities and order number(s). 
- Download/Export the files as a CSV.

Note: An example CSV can be found at the bottom of this solution

#### Step 2: Process your Bulk Order
- Navigate to the **B2B Trade Store > Bulk Order**
- Select **Choose File** and add the file you recently downloaded/exported 
- Click **Upload**

- If your orders are valid you will be taken to the final step where you send the orders.
