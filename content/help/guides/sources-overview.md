## What are sources?
Sources are where data such as product / inventory and customer information originates or can be obtained from.
Generally speaking this is an ERP / Accounting system or any custom database or flatfile that contains such information.
Sales orders and invoices can also be generated programmatically back into your source to close off the order cycle. There are two different types of sources on Stock2Shop, namely:

- [Primary sources](/help/guides/primary-sources/ "Understanding Primary sources in Stock2Shop")
- [Linked sources](/help/guides/linked-sources/ "Understanding Linked sources in Stock2Shop")

## How do you know if your source is supported?
