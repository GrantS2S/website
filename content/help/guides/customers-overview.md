## What are customers in Stock2Shop used for
Customers data can be added to sync from your accounting system (Should your accounting system be supported) or imported directly into Stock2Shop.

Customer data that has been added will then be processed and said customers will then have access to the B2B trade Store displaying the customer specific pricing and warehousing.
Note that the only channel that supports the use of syncing customer data is the Stock2Shop trade store, for any other sales channel customers will need to be managed directly on the channel respectively.
