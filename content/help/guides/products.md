## Adding a product
You can 


1. From your Stock2Shop console, go to Products > Add.
2. Select the [source](/help/guides/source "What is a Stock2Shop source") you will be adding the product to.

## Adding product attributes
On top of creating products with the standard fields Stock2Shop has to offer, you can add any other additional product information that is necessary to your integration using attributes.
There are two ways in which you can manually add product attributes. To add attributes one at a time:

1. From your Stock2Shop console, go to Products > View.
2. Search for the product you would like to add attributes to.
3. Click on the three vertical dots and click edit.
4. Click on the Attributes tab.
5. Define the attribute key or the name of the attribute.
6. Add the value of the attribute.
7. Click Add.

If you have a set of attributes you would like to apply to every product, and then update the value of each attribute, this too can be done.
You will first need to create an attribute template:

1. From your Stock2Shop console, go to Settings > Product Templates.
2. Click Add Template.
3. Name your product template and fill out the following information
    - Add the name of the attribute 
    - Select the attribute type.
    - Set a default attribute value. 
    - Add a description about the attribute.
    - Select whether the attribute is required or not. If an attribute is required it cannot be left blank.
4. Repeat this process until you have created all the attributes in the template that you require.
5. Click Save.

Now that you have created your product attribute template, you can start adding to products:

1. From your Stock2Shop console, go to Products > View.
2. Search for the product you would like to add attributes to.
3. Click on the three vertical dots and click edit.
4. Click on the Attributes tab.
5. Under Attribute Templates, click add on the template you would like to apply to the product.
6. Update the attribute values where required.
7. Click Save All Attributes.
