Some sources do not cater for automatically syncing customers into Stock2Shop. 
If you are making use of Stock2Shop's B2B Trade Store and require customers, please follow the guide below.

When adding new customers to S2S it is important to know your workflow, if S2S is automatically syncing customers from your ERP/Accounting system then you would need to activate the customer in your ERP/Accounting system using the customers active field, if you are unsure contact Support@stock2shop.com

Should your workflow require you to manually add customers to S2S, follow the below guide:

To add directly in the console:

- Login to the S2S admin console

- Hover over "Customers" > click "Add"

- Proceed to create the customer, ensure you understand the fields as they request, shold any be unclear contact support@stock2Shop.com



To add multiple customers using a bulk import:

- Download the template attached or navigate to "Customers" > click "Import" > click the link to download the template

- Populate the template accordingly, paying special attention to the "source_customer_code" - this is the account code as per the ERP/Accounting system and must be exact

- Once you have populated the sheet accordingly ensure you export the sheet as a plain csv

- Navigate to "Customers" > click "Import"

- Select the source(ERP/Accounting System) that the customer list should be linked to

- Select the channel (B2B trade store) that the customers should be linked to, should you have multiple trade store, create separate sheets to import per channel (B2B Trade store)

- Ensure that "Ignore new customers" is not ticked

- Click "BROWSE" to select the csv from your computer that you have just populated

- Click "IMPORT"



Once complete you should see a report of the import showing how many customers were added successfully.
