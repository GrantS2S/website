#### Error description
Failed to raise orders in Omni Accounts

#### Error solution
S2S's Apifact software can no longer contact the Omni Accounts database, or the user credentials are no longer valid.

To resolve this issue:

- Reach out to Omni Accounts specialists and confirm if the server configuration has had any changes.
- Ensure credentials issued to S2S are still valid and granted sufficient access level to the database.
- Ensure all necessary services are running on the server.

Contact support@stock2shop.com if your details have changed or if you need further assistance.
