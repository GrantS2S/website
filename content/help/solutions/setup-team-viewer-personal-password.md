#### Requirements

Although there are no specific requirements to setup the personal password, please inform the support agent of whether your TeamViewer is a paid version or not.
The purpose of setting up a personal password is so that the password does not expire once handed over to the developers for any remote access task.
Should you not have TeamViewer installed on the server that S2S is wanting access, you can download it [HERE](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/).

#### Setup Steps

Below are some steps to setting up a personal password on TeamViewer:

1. Navigate to TeamViewer on the server that your ERP/Accounting in installed on
2. Once the application has loaded and the "Allow Remote Control" has populated, click the refresh arrow of the "Password" 
3. Select "Set Personal Password" 
4. A new window will appear, populate "Password" and "Confirm Password" with a password of your choice and click "OK" 

#### Sharing the password

Once you have created your personal password, you will need to share this with S2S, should you want to be secure, S2S would suggest sending the password and ID on two separate emails directly to the support agent that is assisting you.
