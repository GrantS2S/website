#### Error description
S2S attempted to create an order at source but was rejected by Evolution.

#### Error solution
There is an issue with the Evolution SDK.
1. Confirm by testing the SDK: 
- [https://[tunnel_host].apifact.com:8000/evolution/testSdk](https://[tunnel_host].apifact.com:8000/evolution/testSdk) / (User and password in console source settings)
2. If status false (exit status -1073741502) > then the issue is that SDK is non-functional. 
3. Reach out to Evolution support for further assistance
