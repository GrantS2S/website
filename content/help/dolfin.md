Dolfin is an online accounting system. This means the application lives in the “cloud”. 
Enabling Stock2Shop to work with Dolfin is relatively simple. In order for Stock2Shop to provide you 
with the full integration features and link your Dolfin system to other sales channels and fulfilment 
services such as Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce, Stock2Shops B2B Trade store, Parcelninja and Takealot, 
we need access to your Dolfin.
Below is all documentation you will need regarding your Dolfin integration from start to finish.

## Before We integrate
***

### What we need from you
In order to communicate with your Dolfin accounting system, we require the following information:

- Product Request URL
- Order Request URL
- Company ID
- Username
- Password

Raising orders into Dolfin is a straightforward process. 
During the data discussion one of our Technicians will confirm how orders should be raised.

## During integration
***

### Data discussion
Data discussion is the process whereby we interpret the current information in Sage Business Cloud Accounting
This will allow us to determine how best to ingest your data data into Stock2Shop as well as how to distribute it to your various sales channels.
During the data discussion we will discuss what information we require from Sage Business Cloud Accounting,
what information you need to send to your sales channel(s) as well as the information and settings you require to raise
orders back into Sage Business Cloud Accounting.

### Installation
The installation refers to the actual implementation of the integration where we connect Dolfin
to Stock2Shop and your sales channel(s), based on the previous data discussion.

### Handover and training
At this point our support technicians have set up and configured your system.
We now need to confirm that it works as expected when syncing products and raising orders.
