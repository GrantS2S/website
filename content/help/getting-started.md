## Getting Started
How to get set up on Stock2Shop so that you can streamline your workflow.
Stock2Shop is a flexible system integration solution that can be tailored to your company’s specific needs.

In some cases, depending on your integration requirements, one of our trained engineers will need to advise and help you with the configuration and installation process.
The set up and configuration of Stock2Shop is normally a once-off process – thereafter, you will require little to no involvement from our side, unless you need help. 

We offer initial training for our software and continuous support as you need it. We’re here to help!
In this section of the documentation, we have noted some of the set up requirements and procedures.
