## Introduction

Sage X3 is a client side ERP system. This means the Sage X3 application is installed on a server at your office, on your actual work computer or on a server in the cloud. In order for Stock2Shop to provide you with the full integration capabilities and link Sage X3 to other sales channels and fulfillments services such as Shopify, Magento 1.x, Magento 2.x, WooCommerce, Stock2Shops B2B Trade store and Parcelninja, we need to install software on the server or computer where your Sage X3 is set up.

## What we need from you

### For Accessing Your Server

In order for Stock2Shop to access the data inside of your Sage X3 database and integrate this into other applications, our software has to be installed on the server or computer that has direct access to the Sage X3 database. There are three ways for you to grant us access to install our software on your server:

The below must be taken into consideration to ensure we can manage information on a continual basis:
