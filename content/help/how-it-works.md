## How It Works
There are a few core components that make up Stock2Shop. 
Here are explanations of these key concepts, so you can better understand how we make your business work better.

Stock2Shop offers system integration between many different applications: ERP / Accounting systems (Sage, SYSPRO, iSync or SAP) 
and e-commerce websites ([WooCommerce](/integrations/woocommerce "woocommerce Stock2Shop integration"), 
[Shopify](/integrations/shopify "shopify Stock2Shop integration"), 
[Magento 1.x](/integrations/magento "magento 1.x Stock2Shop integration"), 
[Magento 2.x](/integrations/ "magento 2.x Stock2Shop integration") 
or [B2B trade store](/integrations/b2b-shopping-cart "B2B trade store Stock2Shop integration"). 
Using the Stock2Shop software efficiently and getting the maximum benefit 
from the platform requires an understanding of the key concepts. In this section of the documentation, 
we outline some of these key concepts.
