### Choose when Orders process to your ERP
Orders can be sent to your ERP based on the last status sent from Woocommerce. Once your Order has a status of 
'Processing' it means the payment has completed and the Order is now complete, we use this status by default. 

<!-- product_map -->
### Sync specific Product data 
All Product data sent from Stock2Shop can be filtered as needed.
You might not require a certain amount of details to be sent through with the Product data.
In these cases, we can synchronize only the required data into Stock2Shop to then push up to your Webstore.

<!-- default_fulfillmentservice_id -->
### Fulfill Orders automatically
Orders placed on Woocommerce with Shipping options selected can be sent to supported fulfillment services once the Order 
is sent to your ERP.

### Process Orders using ERP prices
When Orders are sent to Stock2Shop, you can have the option of using the pricing that syncs from your ERP if the pricing 
differs on your Woocommerce store.
This can be set to a specific Price Tier if available.

### Create Products on Woocommerce
When linking to Woocommerce, we will link to any SKUs that match what SKU codes exist in Stock2Shop.
Any SKUs that do not appear on Woocommerce can be created by Stock2Shop and set to a status of you choice.
Stock2Shop can remove SKUs from Woocommerce if needed.

multiple Webstores linked to Stock2Shop.
