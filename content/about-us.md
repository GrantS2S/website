### With a compact, dedicated team, Stock2Shop has managed to accomplish a lot in a short period of time. From our head office in Cape Town, South Africa, we are delivering streamlined integrations to companies around the world.

Our company was established in 2001, and after years of specialising in ecommerce development, we discovered our niche in systems integration. We know who we are and we know who we are not - we don’t build websites, we don’t sell accounting software; we’re specialists in systems integrations. Our goal is to continue adding to our list of Stock2Shop connectors until we have all the major accounting and ecommerce systems covered.
