Stock2Shop is based in Cape Town, South Africa – the heart of Africa’s vibrant e-commerce development community.

Established in 2001, Go Media has been developing software solutions for clients across the globe since then. In 2014, Go Media recognised the need for a robust inventory management solution in the growing online retail and B2B space. Thus, Stock2Shop was born.

Since the completion of the Stock2Shop platform, we have grown from strength to strength. [Many global brands and leading online e-commerce websites](/case-studies) are now using our inventory control solution.

We continue to focus on improving our software and increasing the number of systems we integrate into. Our team of developers are continually upgrading and tweaking the platform, in the relentless pursuit of perfection.
