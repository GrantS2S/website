### Custom Notifications
Assign administrators in your business to receive notifications at various stages of the syncing process. You can also alert specific administrators of certain sync activity, eg the sales manager can receive notifications of successful orders and the IT manager can be notified of failed orders.

### Create Orders Depending on State
You can decide whether all completed Magento orders are synced to your FTP location, or only those that have a specific order state, eg “PROCESSING”.

### Error Management
If an order fails to process, an error will appear in your Stock2Shop console and you will be sent an email notification. The error will give an indication of what caused the failure, and once you’ve rectified the issue, you can reset the order to try again.
