lead: "Stock2Shop can pull inventory data from a variety of databases. The only prerequisite is that the database can be accessed via ODBC. We therefore support Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL Server, Pervasive SQL, Hana and many other databases. Let Stock2Shop send product inventory updates from your custom database to the Takealot Marketplace. And if you are doing exclusively lead time orders, you can automate the dropping off of Takealot orders at an FTP location. Hereâ€™s how we can help you streamline your workflow."
