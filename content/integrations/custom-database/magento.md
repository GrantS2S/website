We therefore support Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL Server, Pervasive SQL, Hana and many other databases. Let Stock2Shop send product updates from your custom database to Magento (1.x or 2.x). In addition, online orders can be dropped off at an FTP location specified by you and trigger an instruction to your warehouse to fulfill. Hereâ€™s how we can help you streamline your workflow."
