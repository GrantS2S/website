### Custom Notifications
Assign administrators in your business to receive notifications at various stages of the syncing process. You can also alert specific administrators of certain sync activity, eg the sales manager can receive notifications of successful orders and the IT manager can be notified of failed orders.

### Ordering Tool for Sales Reps
Your reps can log into their customers’ accounts and place orders on their behalf. Stock2Shop is mobile friendly, making it a useful tool for capturing orders while on the road.

### Allow Back Orders
Enable back orders, allowing customers to continue buying products that are out of stock.

### Offer Payment by Credit Card
You can offer customers the ability to pay upfront by credit card, using one of our accepted payment gateways.

### Error Management
If an order fails to process, an error will appear in your Stock2Shop console and you will be sent an email notification. The error will give an indication of what caused the failure, and once you’ve rectified the issue, you can reset the order to try again.
