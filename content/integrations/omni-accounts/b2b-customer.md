### Onboard Customers
Add wholesale customers onto your Stock2Shop console, including Omni Accounts customer account codes, store allocation and sales reps. When a customer logs in to the B2B Trade Store, they will see relevant pricing and stock availability.

### Segment Customers by Console User (e.g. Sales Rep)
You are able to limit which customers a particular console user is able to view when they log in. This means your sales reps will not have access to each otherâ€™s customers.
