### Custom Notifications
Assign administrators in your business to receive notifications at various stages of the syncing process. You can also alert specific administrators of certain sync activity, eg the sales manager can receive notifications of successful orders and the IT manager can be notified of failed orders.

### Create Orders Depending on Status
You can decide whether all completed Shopify orders are raised into Dolfin, or only those that have a specific order status, eg “PAID”.

### Set your Customer Account Code
Create a default customer account on Dolfin into which all Shopify orders will sync. This will prevent you from having loads of customer accounts on your accounting software unnecessarily.

### Customise Order Fields
You can map the data received on the Shopify order to the relevant fields on the Dolfin sales document. Provided the data can be captured in your standard order screen on Dolfin, it can be added automatically by Stock2Shop.

### Error Management
If an order fails to process to Dolfin, an error will appear in your Stock2Shop console and you will be sent an email notification. The error will give an indication of what caused the failure, and once you’ve rectified the issue, you can reset the order to try again.
