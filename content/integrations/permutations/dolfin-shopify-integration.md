Dolfin Shopify Integration
==========================

If you use Dolfin as your current ERP and Shopify as your e-commerce website, it’s important that they can communicate with each other, with ease. That’s where Stock2Shop comes in: a Dolfin Shopify integration will make your business run smoother.  
  
Here’s what you’ll be able to do:

Sync inventory data
-------------------

You’ll be able to sync inventory data with ease once you’ve integrated with Stock2Shop.

*   Sync your product information from Dolfin to Shopify. This includes the SKU, price, stock availability and product title, and can be updated on schedule (up to every 30 minutes).
*   You can also easily sync your images between Dolfin and Shopify, and you can upload or remove images automatically.
*   Once you’ve configured products correctly on Dolfin (we can help), fields from Dolfin can be “mapped” to any attribute on Shopify. You can choose the categories, sub-categories and brand tags that suit you. We’ll work with you to create a flexible system that suits your needs.
*   If you have variations in your products (e.g. one shoe that comes in multiple sizes), we can create one product with multiple variants in Shopify automatically.
*   It’s up to you to decide which price list will sync to Shopify, and which warehouses (or which combination of warehouses) on Dolfin will sync to Shopify. We’ll help you to create a custom workflow that works for you.
*   Because Dolfin is so flexible and customisable, we understand that each business has a custom structure that works for them. As long as it’s structured correctly, we can adapt to your ERP and bring in whatever combinations and structures you’ve put in place. We understand that your ERP is the brain of your business. Once we’ve integrated it with your Shopify e-commerce website, you can be sure that all the necessary data is in the right place, without the risk of human error.

Enrich data
-----------

Enriching product data so it’s ready to sell is simple once you’ve integrated with Stock2Shop. You can choose a workflow that suits your requirements.

*   A popular workflow, for example, is to sync only SKU, title, quantity and price to Stock2Shop. You can then edit fields such as vendor, product type, collection and images directly on Stock2Shop, which will automatically update Shopify.
*   Another workflow is to update these fields directly on Shopify. Using Stock2Shop flags makes it simple to decide which system manages which field.
*   Either way, enriching product information is not only simple but consistent – whatever changes you make on Stock2Shop are synced with Dolfin and Shopify.

Customise product workflow
--------------------------

You know exactly what you need from your product workflow: we’ll help you set it up once you’ve enriched your data.

*   You can limit the quantity of products you send to your Shopify e-commerce website (e.g. maximum 50 units per product), and create rules to decide which products are sent.
*   You can assign specific fields (such as brand, description, quantity or price) to different websites.
*   You can create products with multiple variants, depending on your needs.
*   You can join multiple fields into one field before you sync to your Shopify e-commerce website.

Simplify ordering
-----------------

A Dolfin Shopify integration makes your ordering process simple and straightforward.

*   You can automatically raise all orders placed on Shopify into Dolfin as a quote or an invoice.
*   You can decide whether you want all orders to be raised into Dolfin, or only those that have reached “paid” (or any other) status.
*   You can push orders to Dolfin, and not update stock levels or product information, or only update products and not raise orders (a one-way sync) if necessary.
*   Invoices can automatically be sent to the customer once they’ve paid, with a custom email attached.
*   You can decide whether orders go into one customer account in Dolfin, or whether they go into individual accounts. Customer accounts can be created on the fly in Dolfin if required.

Customise ordering
------------------

You can choose how to customise the ordering process so it suits your workflow perfectly.

*   You can customise any field on the order.
*   Shipping costs added to an order can be created as a line item (service item) on the Dolfin invoice or quote.
*   Orders can be assigned to specific sales reps.
*   You can add customer generated references to each order.
*   You can choose to allow negative stock, if required.
*   You can set the due day for each order.
*   It’s up to you to decide whether Dolfin creates the order code, or you use the Shopify order code.
*   You can also decide whether the customer’s address comes from Shopify or the existing customer details in Dolfin. This is particularly useful for B2B and trade transactions.

Automate order fulfillment
--------------------------

You can automate order fulfillment simply and easily once you’ve integrated Dolfin and Shopify.

*   You’ll be able to set up order fulfillment to run automatically.
*   Choose to fulfill the order depending on its status (e.g. paid).
*   Customise order fulfillments according to your workflow requirements.
*   Have a totally automated solution: from placing an online order to delivery.

Customise notifications
-----------------------

A Dolfin Shopify integration lets you customise notifications with ease.

*   You can choose which people receive notifications for specific activities, such as when orders are received, when orders are processed to Sage One Accounting, when orders fail or when product updates fail.
*   Help your team focus by only notifying them of tasks directly related to their work.
*   Reduce the possibility of human error by ensuring nothing goes unnoticed.

Streamline workflow
-------------------

One of the best things about integrating Dolfin and Shopify is that it makes your workflow as efficient as possible.

*   You have access to tools that help with the flow of data.
*   With one central console, your Stock2Shop queue shows all data activity. This queue ensures you never lose precious data (updates or orders) – even if Dolfin or Shopify go offline. You can assign certain people to receive notifications of certain activity, such as orders or errors. You can see orders coming in, with their corresponding order code from Shopify and from Dolfin. And you can monitor product updates. All in one place.
*   It’s business as usual, just better.
