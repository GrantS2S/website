Sync data
---------

You’ll be able to sync inventory data and pricing with ease once you’ve integrated with Stock2Shop.

*   Sync your product information from XERO to your Takealot marketplace. This includes the price, recommended retail price, lead time and stock availability, and can be updated near real time.
*   Once you’ve configured products correctly on XERO (we can help), price lists and stock levels from XERO can be “mapped” to price, recommended retail price and delivery lead time for each of your Takealot marketplace offers.
*   With user defined fields and multiple price lists, your XERO system is the brain of your business. Stock2Shop’s integration enables you to sync necessary data to the Takealot marketplace without the risk of human error.

CUSTOMISE PRODUCT WORKFLOW
--------------------------

Your product workflow is easy to customise, once you’ve enriched your data.

*   You can limit the quantity of products you send to your Takealot marketplace products (e.g. maximum 50 units per product), and create rules to decide which products are updated.
*   You can update price, recommended retail price, lead time and stock availability to your Takealot marketplace offers.
