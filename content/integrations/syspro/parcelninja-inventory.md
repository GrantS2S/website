### Sync Stock Levels
Stock2Shop can automate the updating of stock levels directly from Parcelninja. This means that you can show your ecommerce customers the exact stock levels that exist in the Parcelninja warehouse. No more stock inaccuracies, no more overselling.

### Fulfill Orders
Have a totally automated solution, from receiving an online order to dispatching for delivery. Once an order has successfully been raised into SYSPRO, Stock2Shop can send an automatic outbound notification to Parcelninja so they can pick, pack and deliver.
