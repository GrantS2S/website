### Select your Document Type
You can choose whether the order document created in SYSPRO will be a quote, sales order or invoice.

### Custom Notifications
Assign administrators in your business to receive notifications at various stages of the syncing process. You can also alert specific administrators of certain sync activity, eg the sales manager can receive notifications of successful orders and the IT manager can be notified of failed orders.

### Set your Debtors Account
Create a default customer account on SYSPRO into which all Takealot orders will sync. This will prevent you from having loads of customer accounts on your ERP unnecessarily.

### Error Management
If an order fails to process to SYSPRO, an error will appear in your Stock2Shop console and you will be sent an email notification. The error will give an indication of what caused the failure, and once youâ€™ve rectified the issue, you can reset the order to try again.
