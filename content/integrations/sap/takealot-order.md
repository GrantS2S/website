## Automate Ordering
If you are doing exclusively lead time orders on Takealot, Stock2Shop can automatically raise them in SAP Business One as an invoice, sales order or quote.

- Automatically raise lead time orders into SAP Business One as invoices, sales orders or quotes. 
- The Takealot order number can be mapped to the SAP Business One order reference field.
- Send these lead time orders to a dedicated account in SAP Business One.

** Orders can only be automated where clients are supplying Takealot exclusively on lead time.
