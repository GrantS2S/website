## Sync stock levels
Sync stock levels from Parcelninja into Stock2Shop

- Decide whether SAP Business One or Parcelninja will control the stock levels presented on Magento.

## Automate Fulfillments 
Have a totally automated solution, from placing an online order to delivery.

- Once a Magento order has successfully been raised into SAP as an invoice, sales order or quote, Stock2Shop can send an automatic outbound notification to your 3rd-party logistics partner so they can pick, pack and deliver.
