### Automate Fulfillments
Have a totally automated solution, from placing an online order to delivery.

Once a Shopify order has successfully been raised into SAP Business One as an invoice, sales order or quote, Stock2Shop can send an automatic outbound notification to your 3rd-party logistics partner so they can pick, pack and deliver.

If your WMS or fulfillment partner supports delivery notifications, they return fulfilment information to Stock2Shop (waybill / tracking number / tracking link).
In turn, Stock2Shop can update the Shopify and mark the orders status to “Fulfilled” and in turn notify your customer.
Your customers can then easily track the progress of their order.

### Sync stock levels

If your WMS or fulfillment partner supports stock feeds, Stock2Shop can automate updating stock directly to Shopify.
