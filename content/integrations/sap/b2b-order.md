## Automate Ordering
You can automate orders easily once youâ€™ve integrated SAP Business One and the B2B Trade Store.

- Automatically raise B2B Trade Store orders into SAP as invoices, sales orders or quotes. 
- Shipping costs added to an order can be created as a line item (service item) on the SAP document.
- Enable back orders to allow customers to continue buying products that are out of stock.
- The Quick Order search function makes it easy to see the price and stock availability of desired products, and to add them to the cart with a single click. 
- Bulk Order functionality allows for uploading CSV spreadsheet orders with a large number of line items. 
- Customers are able to checkout without having to pay upfront.

## Customise Order Field Mapping
You can map the data received on the B2B Trade Store order payload to the relevant fields on the SAP sales document e.g. the purchase order number is synced to the customer reference field.
