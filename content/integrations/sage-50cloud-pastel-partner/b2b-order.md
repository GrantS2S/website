### Select your Document Type
You can choose whether the order document created in Sage 50cloud Pastel Partner will be a quote, sales order or invoice.

### Custom Notifications
Assign administrators in your business to receive notifications at various stages of the syncing process. You can also alert specific administrators of certain sync activity, eg the sales manager can receive notifications of successful orders and the IT manager can be notified of failed orders.

### Raise Orders into Each Customer’s Debtors Account
When onboarding a new wholesale customer, simply add them first to Sage 50cloud Pastel Partner and then to the Stock2Shop console, ensuring the account codes correlate. This will enable them to start placing orders directly into their dedicated Sage account.
