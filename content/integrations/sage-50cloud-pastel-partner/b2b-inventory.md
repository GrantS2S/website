### Near Real Time Syncing
Our software continually monitors your Sage 50cloud Pastel Partner database for changes in product information and sends these updates to the B2B Trade Store. So if your pricing or stock levels are adjusted on Sage, it won’t be long before these changes reflect on your store.

### Choose the Data to Sync
You get to decide which data fields are synced from your Sage 50cloud Pastel Partner database. You can also choose whether a particular field is managed by Sage or Stock2Shop.

### Product Information Management (PIM)
Use Stock2Shop as a PIM to enrich product data not found in Sage 50cloud Pastel Partner. You are able to make your products more presentable for online selling by adding images, long descriptions and other marketing material. This is particularly useful should you decide to send product feeds to additional retail websites because you can manage your product enrichment in one place.

### Run Multiple Online Stores from one Sage 50cloud Pastel Partner Database
Once your product data has synced onto Stock2Shop and you have added product enrichment such as images and descriptions, opening data feeds to additional ecommerce websites is easy.

### Accommodate Customer Price Tiers
Assign your customers to a price tier that is linked to the relevant Sage 50cloud Pastel Partner price list, ensuring that when they log into the B2B Trade Store, they see the right prices.

### Assign Customers to a Specific Store
You are able to allocate each customer to a Sage 50cloud Pastel Partner store so that they only see stock availability in a particular location.

### Segment Products by Customer
Choose which products each customer is able to view when logging into the B2B Trade Store.

### Error Management
If an update fails to process to the B2B Trade Store, an error will appear in your Stock2Shop console and you will be sent an email notification. The error will give an indication of what caused the update failure, and once you’ve rectified the issue, you can reset the update to try again.
