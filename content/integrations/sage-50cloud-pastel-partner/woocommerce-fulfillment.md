### Automate Fulfillments
Have a totally automated solution, from placing an online order to dispatching for delivery. Once a WooCommerce order has successfully been raised into Sage 50cloud Pastel Partner, Stock2Shop can send an automatic outbound notification to your 3rd-party logistics partner so they can pick, pack and deliver.

### Sync Stock Levels
If your WMS or fulfillment partner supports stock feeds, Stock2Shop can automate the updating of stock levels directly on WooCommerce.
