### Automate Fulfillments
Have a totally automated solution, from placing an online order to dispatching for delivery. Once an order has successfully been raised into iSync, Stock2Shop can send an automatic outbound notification to your 3rd-party logistics partner so they can pick, pack and deliver.

### Sync Stock Levels
If your WMS or fulfillment partner supports stock feeds, Stock2Shop can automate the updating of stock levels directly on the B2B Trade Store.
