## Customise Product Workflow
You know exactly what you need from your product workflow: we’ll help you set it up once you’ve enriched your data.

You can limit the quantity of products you send to your Shopify e-commerce website (e.g. maximum 50 units per product), and create rules to decide which products are sent.

You can assign specific fields (such as brand, description, quantity or price) to different websites.

You can create products with multiple variants, depending on your needs. You can join multiple fields into one field before you sync to your Shopify e-commerce website.
