## Sync Inventory Data
You’ll be able to sync inventory data and pricing with ease once you’ve integrated with Stock2Shop.

- Sync inventory information from SAP Business One to your existing marketplace offers. This includes the price, recommended retail price, lead time and stock availability, and can be updated near real time.
- Once you’ve configured products correctly on SAP Business One (we can help), price lists and stock levels from SAP Business One can be “mapped” to price, recommended retail price and delivery lead time for each of your Takealot marketplace offers.
- Now that Takealot is kept informed of your lead time stock levels, your risk of overselling is greatly reduced.

** Stock2Shop is not able to create products on Takealot, only update existing offers.
