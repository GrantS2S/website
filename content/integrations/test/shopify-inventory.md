## Sync Inventory Data
Keep your Shopify product data up to date, including pricing, stock levels and more.

- Sync your product information from SAP Business One to Shopify. This includes the SKU, price, stock availability and product title. 
- Upload product images to your Stock2Shop console or add them directly to your Shopify website. 
- Once you’ve configured products correctly on SAP Business One (we can help), fields from SAP can be “mapped” to standard attributes on Shopify. We’ll advise on the most suitable workflow. 
- If you have variations in your products (e.g. one shoe that comes in multiple sizes), we can create one product with many variants in Shopify automatically. 
- You can decide which price list will sync from SAP Business One to Shopify. 
- You can decide to sync SAP Business One warehouses to one or many inventory locations in Shopify.
- You can decide which warehouse (or combination of warehouses) on your SAP Business One will control stock availability on Shopify. 
- You can choose which admin staff members receive notifications for specific sync activities, such as when product updates fail.
- With one central console, your Stock2Shop queue shows all data activity. This queue ensures you never lose precious data (updates or orders) – even if SAP Business One or Shopify go offline.
- We understand that your ERP is the brain of your business. As long as your data is structured correctly, we can adapt to your SAP Business One setup. Once we’ve integrated with your Shopify ecommerce website, you can be sure that all the necessary data is in the right place, without the risk of human error.

## Enrich Data
Make your products more presentable online.

- Enriching your products involves the addition of images, long descriptions, categorisation and other marketing information that may not exist in SAP Business One. Stock2Shop allows you to add enrichment in a number of ways so that your products are suitably presented on the website. 
- A popular workflow is to sync only SKU, title, quantity and price from SAP Business One to Stock2Shop. You can then edit fields such as vendor, product type, collection and images on the Stock2Shop console, which will automatically update Shopify. 
- Another workflow is to update these fields directly on Shopify. Using Stock2Shop flags makes it simple to decide which system manages which field.
- Either way, enriching product information is not only simple but consistent – whatever changes you make on Stock2Shop are synced to Shopify.
