## Sync Inventory Data
Keep your Shopify product data up to date, including pricing, stock levels and more.

- We understand that your ERP is the brain of your business. Once you’ve configured products correctly on SAP Business One (we can help), product data can be “mapped” to standard fields on Shopify. These include the SKU code, price, stock availability, product title, collection and product type.
- If you sell products that are available in many variations (e.g. one shoe that comes in multiple sizes), we can create multi-variant products in Shopify automatically. 
- You can decide which price list will sync from SAP Business One to Shopify. 
- You are able to sync SAP Business One warehouses to one or many inventory locations in Shopify.
- You can decide which warehouse (or combination of warehouses) on your SAP Business One will control stock availability on Shopify. 

## Enrich Data
Make your products more presentable online.

- Enriching your products involves the addition of images, descriptions, collections and other marketing information that may not exist in SAP Business One. Stock2Shop allows you to add enrichment in a number of ways so that your products are suitably presented on the website. 
- A popular workflow is to sync only SKU, title, quantity and price from SAP Business One to Stock2Shop. You can then edit fields such as vendor, product type, collection and images on the Stock2Shop console, which will automatically update Shopify. 
- Another workflow is to update these fields directly on Shopify after the products have populated on the website.
- If your products already exist on Shopify, all you need to do is ensure your SKU codes correlate with your SAP item codes, and Stock2Shop will keep your pricing and stock availability up to date.
