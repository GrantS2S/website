### Sync Inventory Data

Keep your Shopify product data up to date, including pricing, stock levels and more.

We map Sap Business One database fields to a Shopify product.
These include the SKU code, price, stock availability, product title, collection and product type.

Decide which price list will sync from SAP to Shopify.

You can choose to sync SAP Business One warehouses to one or many inventory locations within Shopify.

### Data Enrichment

Make your products more presentable online.

Enriching your products involves the addition of images, descriptions, collections and other marketing information that may not exist in SAP Business One.

Stock2Shop allows you to add enrichment in a number of ways so that your products are suitably presented on the website.

A popular workflow is to sync only SKU, title, quantity and price from SAP Business One to Stock2Shop.
You can then your additional product information on Stock2Shop directly, which will automatically update Shopify.

Yest another workflow is to update these fields directly on Shopify.
