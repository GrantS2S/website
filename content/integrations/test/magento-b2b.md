## Multiple Price Tiers
Give your wholesale customers preferential pricing on your Magento Store.

- Create multiple customer groups on Magento and link each one to a different SAP Business One price list.
- The customer group to which a wholesale customer has been assigned will determine the pricing they see when logged into Magento. 

## Orders Raised to Customer’s Debtors Account
Capture each wholesale customer’s orders into their dedicated debtors account on SAP Business One.

- When assigning a reseller to a customer group, you can capture their SAP customer code on their Magento profile so that orders sync into their dedicated debtors account.
Magento allows you to specify payment options for each customer group. This means you can enable your wholesalers to place orders into SAP Business One without having to pay upfront.
