## Sync Inventory Data
Keep your Magento product data up to date, including pricing, stock levels and more.

- We understand that your ERP is the brain of your business. Once you’ve configured products correctly on SAP Business One (we can help), product data can be “mapped” to fields on Magento. These include the SKU code, price, stock availability, product name, category and custom attributes.
- If you sell products that are available in many variations (e.g. one shoe that comes in multiple sizes), we can create multi-variant products in Magento automatically. 
- Each customer group on Magento can be linked to a different SAP price list, allowing you to place your customers on different price tiers. 
- You can decide which warehouse (or combination of warehouses) on your SAP Business One will control stock availability on Magento. 

## Enrich Data
Make your products more presentable online.

- Enriching your products involves the addition of images, descriptions, categorisation and other marketing information that may not exist in SAP Business One. Stock2Shop allows you to add enrichment in a number of ways so that your products are suitably presented on the website. 
- A popular workflow is to sync only SKU, title, quantity and price from SAP Business One to Stock2Shop. You can then edit fields on the Stock2Shop console which will automatically update Magento. 
- Another workflow is to update these fields directly on Magento after the products have populated on the website.
- If your products already exist on Magento, all you need to do is ensure your SKU codes correlate with your SAP item codes, and Stock2Shop will keep your pricing and stock availability up to date.
