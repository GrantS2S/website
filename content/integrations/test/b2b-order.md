## Automate Ordering
You can automate orders easily once youâ€™ve integrated SAP Business One and the B2B Trade Store.

- Automatically raise B2B Trade Store orders into SAP as invoices, sales orders or quotes. 
- Quick Order functionality for sales reps and/or customers. 
- Bulk Order functionality for uploading CSV spreadsheet orders with a large number of line items. 
- Shipping costs added to an order can be created as a line item (service item) on the SAP document. 

## Customise Order Field Mapping
You can map any of the data received on the B2B Trade Store order payload to be inserted into relevant fields on the SAP sales document e.g. the B2B Trade Store order number can be mapped to the customer reference field.
