## Sync stock levels
Sync stock levels from Parcelninja into Stock2Shop.

- Decide whether SAP Business One or Parcelninja will control the stock levels presented on Shopify.

## Automate Fulfillments 
Have a totally automated solution, from placing an online order to delivery.

- Once a Shopify order has successfully been raised into SAP Business One as an invoice, sales order or quote, Stock2Shop can send an automatic outbound notification to your 3rd-party logistics partner so they can pick, pack and deliver.
- When Parcelninja receives the order notification, they return fulfilment information to Stock2Shop (waybill / tracking number / tracking link). In turn, Stock2Shop will update the Shopify order status to “Fulfilled”. 
- Your customers can then easily track the progress of their order, and they are notified when Parcelninja has made delivery.
