## Sync stock levels
Synced stock levels from Parcelninja into Stock2Shop.

- Decide whether SAP Business One or Parcelninja will control the stock levels presented on your B2B Trade Store. 

## Automate Fulfillments 
Have a totally automated solution, from placing an online order to delivery.

- Once a B2B Trade Store order has successfully been raised into SAP as an invoice or sales order, Stock2Shop can send an automatic notification to your 3rd-party logistics partner so they can pick, pack and deliver.
