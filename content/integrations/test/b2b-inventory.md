## Sync Inventory Data
Keep your B2B Trade Store product data up to date, including pricing, stock levels and more. 

- Present pricing specific to each of your wholesale customers by assigning them to relevant price lists or accommodating contract discount structures within SAP. 
- Allocate a customer to a specific warehouse if required, thereby limiting the stock availability to a particular region. 
- Enable back order to allow customers to continue buying products that are out of stock. 
- Make it easy for your customers to find the products they are looking for, either by using the powerful Elasticsearch functionality or through segmenting inventory by attribute (e.g. category, brand etc.). 
- Sync your product information from SAP Business One to the B2B Trade Store, including the SKU, price, stock availability and product title.
- If you have variations in your products (e.g. one shoe that comes in multiple sizes), we can create one product with many variants in the B2B Trade Store automatically. 

## Enrich Data 
Make your products more presentable online.

- Enriching your products involves the addition of images, long descriptions, categorisation and other marketing information that may not exist in SAP. Enrichment added to your Stock2Shop console is sent to your B2B Trade Store, ensuring your products are presented in a more attractive way. 
- Once youâ€™ve synced the SKU, title, quantity and price from SAP Business One to Stock2Shop, you can then edit fields such as vendor, product type, collection and images directly on your console, which will automatically update the B2B Trade Store.
