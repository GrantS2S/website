## Sync Inventory Data
Keep your B2B Trade Store product data up to date, including pricing, stock levels and more.  

- We understand that your ERP is the brain of your business. Once you’ve configured products correctly on SAP Business One (we can help), product data can be “mapped” to fields and attributes on your B2B Trade Store, including the SKU, price, stock availability and product title.
- If you sell products that are available in many variations (e.g. one shoe that comes in multiple sizes), we can create multi-variant products in your B2B Trade Store automatically.
- Present pricing specific to each of your wholesale customers by assigning them to relevant price lists, or accommodating contract discount structures within SAP. 
- Allocate a customer to a specific warehouse if required, thereby limiting the stock available for purchase to a particular region. 
- Make it easy for your customers to find the products they are looking for, either by using the powerful Elasticsearch functionality or through segmenting inventory by attribute (e.g. category, brand etc). 
- Segment products by customer - choose which products each customer is able to see when they log into your B2B Trade Store.

## Enrich Data 
Make your products more presentable online.

- Enriching your products involves the addition of images, descriptions, categorisation and other marketing information that may not exist in SAP Business One. Enrichment added to your Stock2Shop console is sent to your B2B Trade Store, ensuring your products are presented in a more attractive and navigable way.
- Once you’ve synced the SKU, title, quantity and price from SAP Business One to Stock2Shop, you can then edit fields such as vendor, product type, collection and images directly on your console, which will automatically update the B2B Trade Store.
