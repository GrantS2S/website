## Automate Ordering
You can automate orders easily once youâ€™ve integrated SAP Business One and Shopify.

- Automatically raise Shopify orders into SAP Business One as invoices, sales orders or quotes. 
- Shipping costs added to an order can be created as a line item (service item) on the SAP Business One document. 
- The Shopify order number can be mapped to the SAP Business One order reference field.

## Customise Order Field Mapping
You can map the data received on the Shopify order payload to the relevant fields on the SAP Business One sales document e.g. the Shopify order number is synced to the customer reference field. 

- Orders can be assigned to a specific sales rep.
- You can choose whether SAP Business One creates the order code, or you use the code generated by Shopify.
