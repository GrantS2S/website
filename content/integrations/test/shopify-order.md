## Automate Ordering
Orders received from Shopify can be raised in SAP Business One as an invoice, sales order or quote.

- Send Shopify orders into SAP Business One automatically.
- Automatically raise Shopify orders into SAP Business One as invoices, sales orders or quotes. 
- Shipping costs added to an order can be created as a line item (service item) on the SAP Business One document. 
- You can choose to allow negative stock, if required. 
- The Shopify order number can be added to the SAP Business One order as a reference.
- You can decide whether orders go into one customer account in SAP Business One, or whether they go into individual accounts. Customer accounts can be created on the fly in SAP Business One if required. 
- You can choose which admin staff members receive notifications for order sync activities, such as when orders are received, when orders are processed successfully or when orders fail. 
- You can decide whether you want all orders to be raised into SAP Business One, or only those that have reached “paid” status.

## Customise Order Field Mapping
You can map any of the data received on the Shopify order payload to be inserted into relevant fields on the SAP Business One sales document e.g. the Shopify order number can be mapped to the customer reference field. 

- Orders can be assigned to a specific sales rep.
- You can add customer generated references to each order.
- It’s up to you to decide whether SAP Business One creates the order code, or you use the Shopify order code.
- You can also decide whether the customer’s address from the order comes from Shopify or the existing customer details in SAP Business One. (You can use the customer’s details on the order to populate the billing/shipping address).
