## Manage orders

You’ll be able to sync inventory data with ease once you’ve integrated with Stock2Shop.

Sync your product information from SAP Business One to Shopify. This includes the SKU, price, stock availability and product title, and can be updated on schedule (up to every 30 minutes).

You can also easily sync your images between SAP Business One and Shopify, and you can upload or remove images automatically.

Once you’ve configured products correctly on SAP Business One (we can help), fields from SAP Business One can be “mapped” to any attribute on Shopify. You can choose the categories, sub-categories and brand tags that suit you. We’ll work with you to create a flexible system that suits your needs.

If you have variations in your products (e.g. one shoe that comes in multiple sizes), we can create one product with multiple variants in Shopify automatically.

It’s up to you to decide which price list will sync to Shopify, and which warehouses (or which combination of warehouses) on SAP Business One will sync to Shopify. We’ll help you to create a custom workflow that works for you.

Because SAP Business One is so flexible and customisable, we understand that each business has a custom structure that works for them. As long as it’s structured correctly, we can adapt to your ERP and bring in whatever combinations and structures you’ve put in place. We understand that your ERP is the brain of your business. Once we’ve integrated it with your Shopify e-commerce website, you can be sure that all the necessary data is in the right place, without the risk of human error.
r way, enriching product information is not only simple but consistent – whatever changes you make on Stock2Shop are synced with SAP Business One and Shopify.
