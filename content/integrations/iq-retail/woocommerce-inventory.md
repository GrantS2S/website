### Near Real Time Syncing
Our software continually monitors your IQ Retail database for changes in product information and sends these updates to WooCommerce. So if your pricing or stock levels are adjusted on IQ Retail, it won’t be long before these changes reflect on your website.

### Choose the Data to Sync
You get to decide which data fields are synced from your IQ Retail database. You can also choose whether a particular field is managed by IQ Retail, Stock2Shop or WooCommerce.

### Product Information Management (PIM)
Use Stock2Shop as a PIM to enrich product data not found in IQ Retail. You are able to make your products more presentable for online selling by adding images, long descriptions and other marketing material. This is particularly useful when sending product data to multiple online stores because you can manage most of your product enrichment in one place.

### Run Multiple Online Stores from one IQ Retail Database
Once your product data has synced onto Stock2Shop and you have added product enrichment such as images and descriptions, opening data feeds to multiple WooCommerce websites is easy.

### Assign a Price List
You decide which price list on IQ Retail is synced to your WooCommerce channel. If you have multiple websites, each one can be assigned a different price list.

### Sync Inventory from One or Multiple Warehouses on IQ Retail
You can choose which warehouse (or combination of warehouses) on IQ Retail updates your stock quantities on WooCommerce.

### Error Management
If an update fails to process to your WooCommerce website, an error will appear in your Stock2Shop console and you will be sent an email notification. The error will give an indication of what caused the update failure, and once you’ve rectified the issue, you can reset the update to try again.
