### Custom Notifications
Assign administrators in your business to receive notifications at various stages of the syncing process. You can also alert specific administrators of certain sync activity, eg the sales manager can receive notifications of successful orders and the IT manager can be notified of failed orders.

### Create Orders Depending on State
You can decide whether all completed Magento orders are raised into IQ Retail, or only those that have a specific order state, eg “PROCESSING”.

### Raise Orders into the Correct Debtors Account
Create a default account on IQ Retail into which all retail Magento orders will sync. For wholesale customers, you can ensure their orders flow into their dedicated IQ Retail account.

### Customise Order Fields
You can map the data received on the Magento order to the relevant fields on the IQ Retail sales document. Provided the data can be captured in your standard order screen on SAP, it can be added automatically by Stock2Shop.

### Error Management
If an order fails to process to IQ Retail, an error will appear in your Stock2Shop console and you will be sent an email notification. The error will give an indication of what caused the failure, and once you’ve rectified the issue, you can reset the order to try again.
