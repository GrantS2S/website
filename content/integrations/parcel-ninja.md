## How we integrate ParcelNinja with Sage Pastel products

Stock2Shop integrates Parcelninja and Sage Pastel products, such as Pastel Evolution and Pastel Partner. 
A order created in Pastel can be automatically sent to Parcelninja for fulfillment. 
Stock2Shop can also generate inventory reports based on your physical inventory which is sitting in Parcelninja’s 
warehouse and the virtual inventory in your Pastel. This simple “stock take” report enables you to view discrepancies 
in stock levels at the click of a button.

## Benefits
#### Save time & avoid errors
By letting Stock2Shop automatically send orders from your Pastel system to Parcelninja, the order is not needed to be captured twice. This saves time and avoids data capturing errors.
#### Keep track of your stock
Report on stock levels in your warehouse against stock levels in Pastel. After goods have been delivered to Parcelninja’s warehouse you are able to make sure the goods received are correct as per your purchase order.
