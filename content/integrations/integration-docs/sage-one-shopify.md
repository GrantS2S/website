# SAGE BUSINESS CLOUD ACCOUNTING SHOPIFY INTEGRATION
If you’re currently using Sage Business Cloud Accounting (formerly Sage One) as your ERP and Shopify as your e-commerce website, you’ll want them to talk to each other. That’s where Stock2Shop comes in: let us integrate Sage Business Cloud Accounting and Shopify to make your day-to-day business easier.

Here’s what you’ll be able to do:

## SYNC INVENTORY DATA
Syncing inventory data is simple once you’ve integrated with Stock2Shop.

- Sync your product information from Sage Business Cloud Accounting (formerly Sage One) to Shopify. This includes the SKU, price, stock availability and product title, and can be updated on schedule (up to every 30 minutes).
- You can also easily sync your images between Sage Business Cloud Accounting and Shopify, and you can upload or remove images automatically..
- Once you’ve configured products correctly on Sage Business Cloud Accounting (we can help), fields from Sage Business Cloud Accounting can be “mapped” to any attribute on Shopify. We’ll work with you to create a flexible system that suits your needs.
- If you have variations in your products (e.g. one shoe that comes in multiple sizes), we can create one product with many variants in Shopify automatically.
- With nine user defined fields and infinite price lists on Sage Business Cloud Accounting, as well as the option for multi-currency sales, your ERP is the brain of your business. Once we’ve integrated it with your Shopify e-commerce website, you can be sure that all the necessary data is in the right place, without the risk of human error.

## ENRICH DATA

There are several workflows for enriching product data so it is ready to sell. These workflows depend on your requirements.

- A popular workflow, for example, is to sync only SKU, title, quantity and price to Stock2Shop. You can then edit fields such as vendor, product type, collection and images directly on Stock2Shop, which will automatically update Shopify.
- Another workflow is to update these fields directly on Shopify. Using Stock2Shop flags makes it simple to decide which system manages which field.
- Either way, enriching product information is not only simple but consistent – whatever changes you make on Stock2Shop are synced with Sage Business Cloud Accounting and Shopify.

## CUSTOMISE PRODUCT WORKFLOW

Once you’ve enriched your data, you can decide exactly how to set up your product workflow.

- You can limit the quantity of products you send to your Shopify e-commerce website (e.g. maximum 50 units per product), and create rules to decide which products are sent.
- You can assign specific fields (such as brand, description, quantity or price) to different websites.
- You can create products with multiple variants, depending on your needs.
- You can join multiple fields into one field before you sync to your Shopify e-commerce website.

## SIMPLIFY ORDERING

There are a number of choices you can make to customise the ordering process so it suits your workflow perfectly.

- You can customise any field on the order.
Shipping costs added to an order can be created as a line item (service item) on the Sage Business Cloud Accounting invoice or quote.
Orders can be assigned to specific sales reps.
- You can add customer-generated references to each order.
- You can choose to allow negative stock, if required.
- You can set the due day for each order.
- It’s up to you to decide whether Sage Business Cloud Accounting creates the order code, or you use the Shopify order code.
- You can also decide whether the customer’s address comes from Shopify or the existing customer details in Sage Business Cloud Accounting. This is particularly useful for B2B and trade transactions.

## STREAMLINE ORDERING

The ordering process is simple once you’ve integrated Sage Business Cloud Accounting and Shopify with Stock2Shop.

- You can automatically raise all orders placed on Shopify into Sage Business Cloud Accounting as a quote or an invoice.
- You can add any prefix to the order numbers, to make it easier to keep track.
- You can decide whether you want all orders to be raised into Sage Business Cloud Accounting, or only those that have reached “paid” (or any other) status.
- You can push orders to Sage Business Cloud Accounting, and not update stock levels or product information, or only update products and not raise orders (a one-way sync) if necessary.
- Invoices can automatically be sent to the customer once they’ve paid, with a custom email attached.
- You can decide whether orders go into one customer account in Sage Business Cloud Accounting, or whether they go into individual accounts. Customer accounts can be created on the fly in Sage Business Cloud Accounting (formerly Sage One) if required.

## AUTOMATE ORDER FULFILLMENT

Once you’ve integrated Sage Business Cloud Accounting and Shopify, it’s easy to push orders to a fulfillment service.

- You’ll be able to set up order fulfillment to run automatically.
- Choose to fulfill the order depending on its status (e.g. paid).
- Customise order fulfillments according to your workflow requirements.
- Have a totally automated solution: from placing an online order to delivery.

## CUSTOMISE NOTIFICATIONS

When you integrate Sage Business Cloud Accounting and Shopify, you’ll be able to customise notifications.

- You can choose which people receive notifications for specific activities, such as when orders are received, when orders are processed to Sage Business Cloud Accounting, when orders fail or when product updates fail.
- Help your team focus by only notifying them of tasks directly related to their work.
- Reduce the possibility of human error by ensuring nothing goes unnoticed.

## STREAMLINE WORKFLOW

Integrating Sage Business Cloud Accounting and Shopify makes your workflow simple and more effective.

- You have access to tools that help with the flow of data.
- With one central console, your Stock2Shop queue shows all data activity. This queue ensures you never lose precious data (updates or orders) – even if Sage Sage Business Cloud Accounting or Shopify go offline. You can assign certain people to receive notifications of certain activity, such as orders or errors. You can see orders coming in, with their corresponding order code from Shopify and from Sage Business Cloud Accounting. And you can monitor product updates. All in one place.
- It’s business as usual, just better.
