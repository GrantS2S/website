## Dolfin Shopify Integration

If you’re using Dolfin to manage your product data and Shopify as your ecommerce website, 
you’ll want to keep them in sync to ensure that your customers see accurate stock availability and pricing. 
Let Stock2Shop integrate Dolfin and Shopify for a more efficient workflow. 

## Sync Product & Inventory Data
Sync product and inventory updates from Dolfin to Shopify.

### Sync Inventory Data 
Sync your product information from Dolfin to Shopify. This includes the SKU, price, 
stock availability and product title, and can be updated on schedule (up to every 60 minutes).

You can also easily sync your images to Shopify, and upload or remove images automatically.
Once you’ve configured products correctly on Dolfin (we can help), fields from Dolfin can be “mapped” to 
standard attributes on Shopify. We’ll work with you to create a flexible system that suits your needs. 

If you have variations in your products (e.g. one shoe that comes in multiple sizes), 
we can create one product with many variants in Shopify automatically. 

It’s up to you to decide which price list will sync to Shopify, and which store (or which combination of stores) on 
Dolfin will sync to Shopify. We’ll help you to create a custom workflow that works for you.

We understand that Dolfin is the brain of your business. As long as your data is structured correctly, 
we can adapt to your database setup. Once we’ve integrated with your Shopify ecommerce website, you can be sure that all 
the necessary data is in the right place, without the risk of human error.

### Enrich Data
Enriching your products involves the addition of images, long descriptions, categorisation and other 
marketing information that may not exist in Dolfin. Stock2Shop allows you to add enrichment in a number of 
ways so that your products are suitably presented on the website. 

A popular workflow is to sync only SKU, title, quantity and price to Stock2Shop. 
You can then edit fields such as vendor, product type, collection and images directly on Stock2Shop, 
which will automatically update Shopify. 

Another workflow is to update these fields directly on Shopify.
Using Stock2Shop flags makes it simple to decide which system manages which field.
 
Either way, enriching product information is not only simple but consistent – 
whatever changes you make on Stock2Shop are synced to Shopify. 

## Raise Orders
Sync orders from Shopify back into Dolfin 

### Automate Ordering
Automatically raise Shopify orders into Dolfin as sales.
Shipping costs added to an order can be created as a line item (service item) on the Dolfin sale. 
You can choose to allow negative stock, if required.

### Customise Order Field Mapping
Any of the data fields that exist in Dolfin can be mapped to be populated from the fields 
Shopify passes on the order payload.

## 3rd-Party Logistics Integration
Once an order has been raised in Dolfin, fulfill your order with one of our fulfilment connectors.

### Sync stock levels
Sync stock levels from Parcelninja into Stock2Shop.
Decide whether Dolfin or Parcelninja will control the stock levels presented on Shopify.

### Automate Fulfilments 
Once a Shopify order has successfully been raised into Dolfin as a sale, 
Stock2Shop can send an automatic notification to your 3rd-party logistics partner so they can pick, pack and deliver.
