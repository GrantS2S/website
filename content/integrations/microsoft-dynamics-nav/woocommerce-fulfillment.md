### Raise Fulfillments
Fulfill your orders with one of our logistics partners or directly in your WMS (Warehouse Management System).

### Automate Fulfillments
Have a totally automated solution, from placing an online order to dispatching for delivery. Once a valid WooCommerce order has been received, Stock2Shop can send an automatic outbound notification to your 3rd-party logistics partner so they can pick, pack and deliver.

### Sync Stock Levels
If your WMS or fulfillment partner supports stock feeds, Stock2Shop can automate the updating of stock levels directly on WooCommerce.
