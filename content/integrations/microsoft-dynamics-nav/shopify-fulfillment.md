### Raise Fulfillments 
Fulfill your orders with one of our logistics partners or directly in your WMS (Warehouse Management System).

### Automate Fulfillments 
Have a totally automated solution, from placing an online order to dispatching for delivery. Once a valid Shopify order has been received, Stock2Shop can send an automatic outbound notification to your 3rd-party logistics partner so they can pick, pack and deliver.

If your WMS or fulfillment partner supports delivery notifications, they will return fulfilment data to Stock2Shop (waybill / tracking number / tracking link). The Shopify order will then be updated with this information and the order’s state is changed to “Fulfilled”. Your customers can then easily track the progress of their order.

### Sync Stock Levels
If your WMS or fulfillment partner supports stock feeds, Stock2Shop can automate the updating of stock levels directly on Shopify.
