titleProductCol11: "Sync Inventory Data"
subtitleProductCol11: "You’ll be able to sync inventory data with ease once you’ve integrated with Stock2Shop."
textCol11: "Sync your product information from SAP Business One to Shopify. This includes the SKU, price, stock availability and product title, and can be updated on schedule (up to every 30 minutes)."
textCol12: "You can also easily sync your images between SAP Business One and Shopify, and you can upload or remove images automatically."
textCol13: "Once you’ve configured products correctly on SAP Business One (we can help), fields from SAP Business One can be “mapped” to any attribute on Shopify. You can choose the categories, sub-categories and brand tags that suit you. We’ll work with you to create a flexible system that suits your needs."
textCol14: "If you have variations in your products (e.g. one shoe that comes in multiple sizes), we can create one product with multiple variants in Shopify automatically."
textCol15: "It’s up to you to decide which price list will sync to Shopify, and which warehouses (or which combination of warehouses) on SAP Business One will sync to Shopify. We’ll help you to create a custom workflow that works for you."
textCol16: "Because SAP Business One is so flexible and customisable, we understand that each business has a custom structure that works for them. As long as it’s structured correctly, we can adapt to your ERP and bring in whatever combinations and structures you’ve put in place. We understand that your ERP is the brain of your business. Once we’ve integrated it with your Shopify e-commerce website, you can be sure that all the necessary data is in the right place, without the risk of human error."

titleProductCol21: "Enrich Data"
subtitleProductCol22: "Enriching product data so it’s ready to sell is simple once you’ve integrated with Stock2Shop. You can choose a workflow that suits your requirements."
textCol21: "A popular workflow, for example, is to sync only SKU, title, quantity and price to Stock2Shop. You can then edit fields such as vendor, product type, collection and images directly on Stock2Shop, which will automatically update Shopify."
textCol22: "Another workflow is to update these fields directly on Shopify. Using Stock2Shop flags makes it simple to decide which system manages which field."
textCol23: "Either way, enriching product information is not only simple but consistent – whatever changes you make on Stock2Shop are synced with SAP Business One and Shopify."

textInformationCol24: "Invoices can automatically be sent to the customer once they’ve paid, with a custom email attached."
textInformationCol25: "You can decide whether orders go into one customer account in SAP Business One, or whether they go into individual accounts. Customer accounts can be created on the fly in SAP Business One if required."

You can see orders coming in, with their corresponding order code from Shopify and from SAP Business One. And you can monitor product updates. All in one place."
