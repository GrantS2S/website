### Near Real Time Syncing
Stock2Shop fetches changes in product information from your Sage Business Cloud Accounting on a regular basis and sends these updates to Shopify. So if your pricing or stock levels are adjusted on Sage, it won’t be long before these changes reflect on Shopify.

### Choose the Data to Sync
You get to decide which data fields are synced from your Sage Business Cloud Accounting database. You can also choose whether a particular field is managed by Sage, Stock2Shop or Shopify.

### Product Information Management (PIM)
Use Stock2Shop as a PIM to enrich product data not found in Sage Business Cloud Accounting. You are able to make your products more presentable for online selling by adding images, long descriptions and other marketing material. This is particularly useful when sending product data to multiple online stores because you can manage your product enrichment in one place.

### Run Multiple Online Stores from one Sage Business Cloud Accounting Database
Once your product data has synced onto Stock2Shop and you have added product enrichment such as images and descriptions, opening data feeds to multiple Shopify websites is easy.

### Assign a Price List
You decide which price list on Sage Business Cloud Accounting is synced to your Shopify channel. If you have multiple websites, each one can be assigned a different price list.

### Error Management
If an update fails to process to your Shopify website, an error will appear in your Stock2Shop console and you will be sent an email notification. The error will give an indication of what caused the update failure, and once you’ve rectified the issue, you can reset the update to try again.
