### Select your Document Type
You can choose whether the order document created in Sage Evolution will be a quote, sales order or invoice.

### Custom Notifications
Assign administrators in your business to receive notifications at various stages of the syncing process. You can also alert specific administrators of certain sync activity, eg the sales manager can receive notifications of successful orders and the IT manager can be notified of failed orders.

### Set your Debtors Account
Create a default customer account on Sage Evolution into which all Takealot orders will sync. This will prevent you from having loads of customer accounts on your ERP unnecessarily.
