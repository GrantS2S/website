### Select your Document Type
You can choose whether the order document created in Sage Evolution will be a quote, sales order or invoice.

### Custom Notifications
Assign administrators in your business to receive notifications at various stages of the syncing process. You can also alert specific administrators of certain sync activity, eg the sales manager can receive notifications of successful orders and the IT manager can be notified of failed orders.

### Create Orders Depending on Status
You can decide whether all completed WooCommerce orders are raised into Sage Evolution, or only those that have a specific order status, eg “PROCESSING”.

### Set your Debtors Account
Create a default customer account on Sage Evolution into which all WooCommerce orders will sync. This will prevent you from having loads of customer accounts on your ERP unnecessarily.

### Customise Order Fields
You can map the data received on the WooCommerce order to the relevant fields on the Sage Evolution sales document. Provided the data can be captured in your standard order screen on Sage, it can be added automatically by Stock2Shop.

### Error Management
If an order fails to process to Sage Evolution, an error will appear in your Stock2Shop console and you will be sent an email notification. The error will give an indication of what caused the failure, and once you’ve rectified the issue, you can reset the order to try again.

### Raise Fulfillments
Fulfill your orders with one of our logistics partners or directly in your WMS (Warehouse Management System).

### Automate Fulfillments
Have a totally automated solution, from placing an online order to dispatching for delivery. Once a WooCommerce order has successfully been raised into Sage Evolution, Stock2Shop can send an automatic outbound notification to your 3rd-party logistics partner so they can pick, pack and deliver.

### Sync Stock Levels
If your WMS or fulfillment partner supports stock feeds, Stock2Shop can automate the updating of stock levels directly on WooCommerce.
