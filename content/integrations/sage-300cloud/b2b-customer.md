### Sync Customer Information
Sync wholesale customers onto your Stock2Shop console, including Sage 300cloud customer account codes, warehouse allocation and pricing contracts. When a customer logs in to the B2B Trade Store, they will see relevant pricing and stock availability. 

### Display Account Information to Customers
Give customers the ability to view important information pertaining to their Sage 300cloud account, including: 
- Credit Limit 
- Current Balance
- Name of their sales rep 
- Last 5 orders

### Segment Customers by Console User (e.g. Sales Rep)
You are able to limit which customers a particular console user is able to view when they log in. This means your sales reps will not have access to each otherâ€™s customers.
