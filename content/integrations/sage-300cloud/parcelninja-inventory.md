### Sync Stock Levels
Stock2Shop can automate the updating of stock levels directly from Parcelninja. This means that you can show your ecommerce customers the exact stock levels that exist in the Parcelninja warehouse. No more stock inaccuracies, no more overselling.

### Send Tracking Information
Update orders on supported sales channels with fulfillment and tracking information (waybill / tracking number / tracking link).

### Fulfill Orders
Once an order has successfully been created in Sage 300cloud, Stock2Shop can send an automatic outbound notification to Parcelninja so they can pick, pack and deliver.
