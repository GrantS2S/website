### Near Real Time Syncing
Our software continually monitors your SAP database for changes in product information and sends these updates to the B2B Trade Store. So if your pricing or stock levels are adjusted on SAP, it wonâ€™t be long before these changes reflect on your store.

### Choose the Data to Sync
You get to decide which data fields are synced from your SAP database. You can also choose whether a particular field is managed by SAP or Stock2Shop.

### Product Information Management (PIM)
Use Stock2Shop as a PIM to enrich product data not found in SAP. You are able to make your products more presentable for online selling by adding images, long descriptions and other marketing material. This is particularly useful should you decide to send product feeds to additional retail websites because you can manage your product enrichment in one place.

### Run Multiple Online Stores from one SAP Database
Once your product data has synced onto Stock2Shop and you have added product enrichment such as images and descriptions, opening data feeds to additional ecommerce websites is easy.

### Accommodate Complex Discount Structures
Whether you are assigning your customers to flat price tiers or you have more complex discount structures (such as matrix pricing or contract pricing), the B2B Trade Store will ensure your resellers see the right amounts when they log in.

### Assign Customers to a Specific Warehouse
You are able to allocate each customer to a SAP warehouse so that they only see stock availability in a particular location.

### Segment Products by Customer
Choose which products each customer is able to view when logging into the B2B Trade Store.

### Error Management
If an update fails to process to the B2B Trade Store, an error will appear in your Stock2Shop console and you will be sent an email notification.
