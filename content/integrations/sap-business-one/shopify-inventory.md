### Near Real Time Syncing
Our software continually monitors your SAP database for changes in product information and sends these updates to Shopify. So if your pricing or stock levels are adjusted on SAP, it won’t be long before these changes reflect on Shopify.

### Choose the Data to Sync
You get to decide which data fields are synced from your SAP database. You can also choose whether a particular field is managed by SAP, Stock2Shop or Shopify.

### Product Information Management (PIM)
Use Stock2Shop as a PIM to enrich product data not found in SAP. You are able to make your products more presentable for online selling by adding images, long descriptions and other marketing material. This is particularly useful when sending product data to multiple online stores because you can manage your product enrichment in one place.

### Run Multiple Online Stores from one SAP Database
Once your product data has synced onto Stock2Shop and you have added product enrichment such as images and descriptions, opening data feeds to multiple Shopify websites is easy.

### Assign a Price List
You decide which price list on SAP Business One is synced to your Shopify channel. If you have multiple websites, each one can be assigned a different price list.

### Inventory to Multiple Locations
You can choose to sync SAP Business One warehouses to one or many inventory locations within Shopify. This means that customers will be able to see location-specific stock levels.

### Error Management
If an update fails to process to your Shopify website, an error will appear in your Stock2Shop console and you will be sent an email notification. The error will give an indication of what caused the update failure, and once you’ve rectified the issue, you can reset the update to try again.
