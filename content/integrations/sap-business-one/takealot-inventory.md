### Near Real Time Syncing
Our software continually monitors your SAP database for changes in inventory information and sends these updates to Takealot. So if your pricing or stock levels are adjusted on SAP, it won’t be long before these changes reflect on Takealot.

### Choose the Data to Sync
Automatically create and update offers against products that exist in Takealot's catalogue. Once linked, Stock2Shop can update the following fields:
- Offer price
- Recommended retail price
- Stock availability (for lead time orders)
- Lead time (the number of days it will take to deliver the product to Takealot)

### Run Multiple Online Stores from one SAP Database
Once you’re integrated with Stock2Shop and are syncing product updates to Takealot, opening data feeds to other ecommerce channels is relatively easy. You could then run multiple online sales channels from one SAP database.

### Assign a Price List
You decide which price list on SAP Business One is synced to the offer price and recommended retail price fields on Takealot Marketplace.

### Sync Inventory from One or Multiple Warehouses on SAP
You can choose which warehouse (or combination of warehouses) on SAP updates your stock quantities on Takealot Marketplace.

### Error Management
If an update fails to process to Takealot, an error will appear in your Stock2Shop console and you will be sent an email notification. The error will give an indication of what caused the update failure, and once you’ve rectified the issue, you can reset the update to try again.
