lead: "You can create attribute sets on your Stock2Shop console and apply one (or more) of these preloaded templates to a particular product group whenever needed. This is extremely useful if you don’t want to overburden your accounting system with loads of data that has no bearing on financial reporting."

Attributes can be used for multiple purposes. For example, it could act as yes/no field that determines which channel a product is synced to, or it could be used for product segmentation such as Category, Gender, Season, Material… whatever makes sense for your business.

## Different types of fields

- true/false
- string
- dropdown (validated)

Attributes can be used for multiple purposes, eg Active field, category data, custom attributes (eg material, gender etc). Basic info (applied to all products), group specific info (eg clothing, footwear and bags etc). You can create default data for each field. You can make a field ‘required’ before a product is updated on the channels. You can add a description to each field so that data capturers know what a field is used for. Below is a guide to using this feature.

## Adding a Product Attribute

- On your Stock2Shop console, find your product list by clicking Product > View in the top menu.
- Go into the backend of any product by clicking the three vertical dots on the righthand side of the screen.
- Click on “Attributes” in the blue bar near the top
- On the righthand side of the screen, click “Create new template”.
- First, you name your template. If this will be a true/false attribute that will decide whether a product syncs to your B2B Trade Store, you might call it “B2B Sync”.
- Then you decide what type of attribute it will be:
    - true/false 
    - string
    - dropdown (validated)
    - Number
- Set your default.

## Using a Product Attribute Template

- Go into the backend of the product to which you would like to add the attribute by clicking the three vertical dots on the righthand side of the screen.
- Click on “Attributes” in the blue bar near the top
- On the righthand side of the screen, click “ADD” next to the attribute template you’d like to apply.
