# Introducing the B2B Trade Store Bulk Ordering Feature
The Stock2Shop B2B Trade Store allows users to import bulk orders via a CSV (Comma-separated values) file. This means that should one of your customers wish to order a large number of products, they can do so easily by uploading a spreadsheet.
The bulk ordering process is very user-friendly. Below are the steps to take when bulk ordering:

## Step 1: Prepare your CSV template
- Make sure your CSV file includes a header row.
- Your CSV needs the following fields:
- SKU (unique product identifier)
- QTY (the number of units to order per SKU)
- Order number (your purchase order number, used to group rows)
- Update the sheet with the SKUs you want to order, along with the quantities and order number(s).
- Download / Export the files as a CSV file.

## Step 2: Process your Bulk Order
- Navigate to the B2B Trade Store > Bulk Order.
- Select Choose File and add the file you recently downloaded/exported.
- Click Upload
- Link the columns from your CSV file to the columns on the B2B Trade store using the dropdowns.
- Click Process once you have completed linking the CSV fields to the order fields.

Note: At this point, your import will be validated to confirm all the SKUs exist in the B2B Trade Store. If the SKUs donâ€™t exist, you will be notified and will need to update your sheet before beginning the import process again.

- If your orders are valid you will be taken to the final step where you submit the orders.
- Simply select the order in question (or all orders) and select Send Orders.

Note: Multiple orders will show based on the number of order numbers you created in your CSV file

## Bulk ordering on behalf of your customers
Should you find that your customers are sending you the CSV files, ordering on behalf of your customers can be easily done by following the above process after signing into their B2B Trade Store. If you are unsure of how to do this, please contact us at support@stock2shop.com, and a technician will help you.

## Import support
Please note that the tax value set on the B2B Trade Store is the tax that will be applied to the products on the import. Should you wish to apply specific taxes to different products or customers, we advise against using the bulk order import.
