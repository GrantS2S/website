The promotions feature allows you to create a storewide promotion which will be applied to every cart at checkout. If you would prefer to limit the promotion to certain customers, you have the ability to create discount coupons for each promotion and issue them to the relevant people.

## Setting up a storewide promotion

Storewide promotions do not make use of coupons. Once created, they will be applied to every checkout until disabled. Setting up a storewide promotion on your Stock2Shop console is simple:

1. Navigate to Settings > Add Promotion.
2. Select the applicable B2B Trade Store Channel.
3. Give your promotion a Name (This is internal, so customers will never see it).
4. Select a Discount Type. This can either be a fixed rate or a % discount of the order.
5. Add the Discount Amount. Note this amount must be entered in Cents.

Because we are not making use of coupons you can leave Use Coupons unchecked and click submit. Now log into your B2B trade and add some items to your cart. When viewing your cart you’ll notice a discount line item being applied by the promotion you created. Below is an example of setting up a storewide promotion.

## Setting up a promotion with coupons

Setting up promotion with the use of coupons gives you the ability to manage who has access to the promotion. Coupons can be generated manually or in bulk. You can control how many times a coupon can be used by setting the Usage Limit, or you can set it to unlimited use by putting a zero (0) in this field. Setting up a promotion with coupons on your Stock2Shop console can be done in a few simple steps:

1. Navigate to Settings > Add Promotion.
2. Select the applicable B2B Trade Store Channel.
3. Give your promotion a Name (This is internal, so customers will never see it).
4. Select a Discount Type. This can either be a fixed rate or a % discount of the order.
5. Add the Discount Amount. Note this amount must be entered in Cents.
6. Check the Use Coupons box.

At this point, some additional information will appear on the screen prompting you to set your coupons up for this promotion. To create a single coupon:
1. Add a coupon code
2. Set the usage limit
3. Click Add

Generating Random Coupons gives you the ability to populate between 1 – 5000 unique coupons with a specific usage limit. To generate multiple coupons:
1. Enter the number of coupons you require
2. Set the usage limit for each coupon
3. Click Generate

## View coupons associated to an existing promotion

Once you have created your coupons, you have the ability to track them within the promotion. Here you can see the usage limits for each coupon as well as how many times a coupon has been used.

The coupon will be the code you give to your customer to use in order to access the discount. If at any point you need to remove a coupon, simply click on the “3 vertical dots” and delete it.

1. Navigate to Settings > Manage Promotions
2. Edit the promotion in question
