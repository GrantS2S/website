#### There is a well known adage in business circles: “Turnover is vanity, profit is sanity, cash is a reality.”

As a wholesaler, giving your resellers favourable terms is a great way to increase turnover and build customer loyalty. But this can be both risky and expensive.The Stock2Shop B2B Cart now allows you to give your resellers the option to pay upfront via credit card.

When checking out, your customer will be presented with the option to either order on account or pay up front via one of the following payment gateways:

1. [Wirecard (Formelry MyGate)](https://www.wirecard.co.za/)
2. [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)

The next time a customer wants to get their payment done and dusted, who are you to stand in their way? Speak to us about enabling this feature and keep your debtors list short and your business firmly grounded in reality.

* * Note: The B2B Cart only supports the Wirecard (formerly MyGate) payment gateway in South Africa, and the Stripe payment gateway for international clients.*
