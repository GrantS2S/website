## What is online order fulfillment?

In essence, online order fulfillment is all the steps between the customer placing the order and receiving the order. That might sound pretty simple, but there are a lot of different steps! Once the order is received, it needs to be processed, the product needs to be picked and packed, and then the parcel needs to be delivered. While many companies choose to do this themselves, others use a fulfillment service. There is a misconception that e-commerce platforms (like Shopify, WooCommerce or Magento) provide this service out of the box. Wouldn’t that be great? If the orders were automatically picked up from your company once you took out an e-commerce subscription! Unfortunately, that’s not the case.

## Thinking through order fulfillment

There are a number of questions to ask yourself that can help when figuring out what your fulfillment process should be, and whether it can be handled in-house or you need to use a service.

- The biggest question is: what happens when someone pays for an order on your store? What are the processes thereafter?
- Do you have somebody to pick and pack your products? Is there a dedicated person on your team who chooses the product and ensures it’s properly packed for delivery?
- Are you selling out of a bricks and mortar store or do you have a warehouse?
- Where do you store your products?
- What kind of fulfillment partner are you considering? A courier service means you do the picking and packing yourself, and they deliver. An outsourced solution like Parcelninja means they store your products in their warehouse and do the picking, packing and delivery.
- Have you done a cost benefit analysis? You need to look at the costs of renting storage space and hiring someone to pick, pack and deliver vs. the monthly storage fee, pick and pack fee and courier fee of outsourcing.
