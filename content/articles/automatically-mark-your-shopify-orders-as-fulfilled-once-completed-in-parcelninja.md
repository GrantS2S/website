If you have or are thinking of using Shopify as your sales channel and Parcelninja as your fulfillment partner, this solution is for you. Once a customer places an order and pays, the following process beings:

- Shopify sends order to Stock2Shop
- Stock2Shop raises order in your ERP / Accounting system
- Stock2Shop sends fulfillment request to Parcelninja (outbound created)
- Parcelninja returns fulfilment information to Stock2Shop (waybill / tracking number / Tracking link)
- Stock2Shop sends fulfillment information to Shopify and updates the order status to “Fulfilled”

Your customers can then easily track the progress of their order, and they are notified when Parcelninja has made delivery.By checking the Orders dashboard on your Stock2Shop console, you can get a quick overview of the status of each order.
