## Online supply chain integration is a simple way to make your business work more efficiently, with fewer errors, streamlined. Here's how to set it up.

Essentially, it’s taking your existing ERP – whether that’s Sage, SAP, iSync, SYSPRO or Omni Accounts – and making it talk to an ordering platform – like Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento or a B2B trade store – and a fulfillment service.

## How do they talk to each other?

It might seem like a complicated concept, but it’s actually quite straightforward.
- Your ERP is always the hub: the source of truth. You control your business from your ERP, as you always have.
- Then there are the multiple channels that you sell on. These could be your own website, a B2B trade store that sells wholesale to retailers, third party retailers like Amazon, or a bricks and mortar store. Think of these channels as points of sales in a check out – each one of them is a till.
- When something is ordered from one of those points of sale, the primary master (also known as the source of truth, also known as your ERP) must verify the order. Is the account valid? Can this sale go forward?
- Only once that’s done can we execute to the fulfillment service to deliver the product.
On the customer’s side, all of this looks like ordering something and having it delivered: as simple as that. That’s what seamless supply chain integration does for you. We integrate the systems you are already using to make them work better: faster, more efficiently and without the risk of human error.

## How does online supply chain integration work for?

Anyone with an e-commerce platform that sells products, whether it’s a B2B trade store or a retail e-commerce website. If you’re selling products online, you need to ensure that your system works – that your ERP and e-commerce platform and fulfillment service are talking to each other. It’s an essential step to guarantee happy customers.

## Why is it so important?

Integrating your supply chain systems saves you time. It frees you from the admin of data capturing issues and manual paperwork and the risk of human error. It streamlines your business: automating processes like price changes and stock updates. And it opens up additional sources of revenue, by allowing you to connect to other sales channels seamlessly. Automation is the future of e-commerce. Being able to sync inventory with an easy-to-use automated system, automate orders from the time they’re ordered to the time they’re delivered, and fulfil orders efficiently and accurately will ensure your business stays ahead of the curve.
