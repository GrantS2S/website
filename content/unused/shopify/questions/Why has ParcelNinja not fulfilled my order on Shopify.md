## Overview 

Stock2Shop can send fulfillment updates from ParcelNinja to Shopify order once ParcelNinja has sent a tracking number and fulfilled the order

## Order Updates:

The following updates are sent to Shopify from ParcelNinja through Stock2Shop system:

1. Stock2Shop sends the tracking number to Shopify order and notifies customer when ParcelNinja has a tracking number
2. Stock2Shop marks orders as fulfilled once the customer has received the goods

## Client testing

When an order is placed client must monitor the next outbound order in both S2S and Shopify, an example of what fulfillment looks like in S2S order:
