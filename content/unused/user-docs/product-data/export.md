Stock2Shop provides a way to export complex product catalog data into a flat file spreadsheet. The format we support is CSV (comma separated value). The exported file can be opened in any spreadsheet application, like Excel for example.

***

To export product data, login to the Stock2Shop console and go to the “Products” section. You will find an “Export products” link. You can select the product fields you want to include in the export.
