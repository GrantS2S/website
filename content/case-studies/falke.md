### Custom build a consumer-facing e-commerce website
- Falke wanted a professional looking B2C website with their distinctive brand look and feel. We custom built them a fully integrated Magento e-commerce website that we host and run.
- We used a well-designed template to build their e-commerce website. This saved them a huge amount of money on customisation costs, which can be better spent on marketing.
- The whole process was simple, straightforward and speedy, with a quick turnaround time.
- The initial inventory management was seamless: all the product data and images were synced from SYSPRO with ease. Stock2Shop set up the data in SYSPRO so that products are automatically synced to their categories going forward.
- To save time, images are added directly on the Stock2Shop console with our automatic bulk image upload feature.
- The site – www.falke.co.za – acts as both a B2C e-commerce website and a B2B ordering platform for their trade customers: one central place for Falke’s online presence.

### Sync Data
- Stock2Shop integrated with SYSPRO so that Falke can now manage their inventory from SYSPRO, while Stock2Shop automatically syncs their data.
- Different price lists are sent from SYSPRO to the Magento e-commerce website (B2C) and the B2B ordering platform.
- We set up a rule to allow Falke to decide which products should sync to the different sales channels. These are updated near real time to ensure up-to-date stock information.

### Manage orders
- Order management is simple thanks to a streamlined workflow. Order information is sent directly to SYSPRO.
- Retail orders are sent to a default account in SYSPRO. B2B (wholesale) orders are sent to a specific customer account.
- Once orders have been received, invoices are sent directly to clients.
- Falke can then pick, pack and distribute the order.
- There’s no need for manual input, no juggling of order forms, just one streamlined e-commerce solution.
