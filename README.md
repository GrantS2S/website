## Help section (suggested structure)
Structure of the help section menu:

```
Menu
  |
  |- Getting Started
  |- Platforms
  |- How Stock2Shop Works
  |- Developer API Docs
```

#### Getting started
Add a generic getting started page for Stock2shop.
This should just be hard coded into the menu as the first item.
This page details the process of getting setup with Stock2Shop:

 - Signing up 
 - Costs 
 - Install
 - Handover
 - Training

#### Platforms
Loop through all Platforms and display on left menu. 
Note: need to confirm how best to do this. 
Naming conventions should not be a factor, as long as it is grouped under the platform.
There should however be at least the following 3 .md files for each platform:

- getting-started.md
- features.md
- solutions.md

```
Platform_1
  |
  |- platform_1-getting-started.md
  |- platform_1-features.md
  |- platform_1-example-order-payload.md
  |- platform_1-user-defined-fields.md
  |- platform_1-solutions.md
  |- any-other-page-relating-to-platform_1.md
  
Platform_2
  |
  |- platform_2-getting-started.md
  |- platform_2-features.md
  |- platform_2-example-order-payload.md
  |- platform_2-user-defined-fields.md
  |- platform_2-solutions.md
  |- any-other-page-relating-to-platform_2.md

  And so on for all platforms.
``` 
  
#### How Stock2Shop Works
How it works should remain as in it's current structure.
Broken up into all the important concepts of stock2shop.
Naming convention is not a factor as long as it is grouped into the correct "section".
